	/*! LZ4_attach_HC_dictionary() : stable since v1.10.0
	 *  This API allows for the efficient re-use of a static dictionary many times.
	 *
	 *  Rather than re-loading the dictionary buffer into a working context before
	 *  each compression, or copying a pre-loaded dictionary's LZ4_streamHC_t into a
	 *  working LZ4_streamHC_t, this function introduces a no-copy setup mechanism,
	 *  in which the working stream references the dictionary stream in-place.
	 *
	 *  Several assumptions are made about the state of the dictionary stream.
	 *  Currently, only streams which have been prepared by LZ4_loadDictHC() should
	 *  be expected to work.
	 *
	 *  Alternatively, the provided dictionary stream pointer may be NULL, in which
	 *  case any existing dictionary stream is unset.
	 *
	 *  A dictionary should only be attached to a stream without any history (i.e.,
	 *  a stream that has just been reset).
	 *
	 *  The dictionary will remain attached to the working stream only for the
	 *  current stream session. Calls to LZ4_resetStreamHC(_fast) will remove the
	 *  dictionary context association from the working stream. The dictionary
	 *  stream (and source buffer) must remain in-place / accessible / unchanged
	 *  through the lifetime of the stream session.
