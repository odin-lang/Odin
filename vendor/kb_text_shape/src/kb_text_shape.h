    WHAT DOES THIS LIBRARY DO?
      Before computers had monitors, the main way of inspecting the output of a command
      was to print it out on real paper. When monitors appeared, most computer graphics
      were text-based, meaning the display was arranged in a hardcoded grid in which each
      cell could hold one of several hardcoded characters. As simple as it is, this kind
      of text handling is sufficient for displaying almost any document written in the
      Latin alphabet and a few other writing systems that happen to fit particularly well
      on a grid, like Chinese and Japanese.
      Handwritten Latin characters do not all have the same width, however. As computers
      became more powerful, glyphs started having different widths to fit better together.
      After that came kerning, which allows for packing glyphs closer together in pairs.
      This is, of course, N-squared in the number of glyphs you want to handle, but this
      is fine for the Latin alphabet, because there really aren't that many glyphs.
      This is where TrueType stops: it is a good and simple, format for displaying text
      using the Latin alphabet or writing systems that happen to work similarly to it.
      All is well and good.

      What about the rest of the writing systems?

      Arabic is a cursive writing system. Much like when we write cursive ourselves, the
      letters need to join together visually. Furthermore, a given letter in Arabic has
      a different appearance depending on whether it is the first letter of a word, the
      last letter of a word, or in the middle, and Unicode does not differenciate between
      any of these. Also, Arabic features a beautiful set of marks that attach to letters,
      much like accents in the Latin alphabet. You would usually want to align these marks
      in some way depending on which other marks are present in the immediate vicinity.

      Indic scripts, like Devanagari, have even less in common with Latin than Arabic does.

      To try to support the plethora of writing systems out there, OpenType was introduced.
      OpenType fonts contain rules that allow modifying a sequence of glyphs through pattern
      matching. These rules can modify both the content of the sequence (ligatures replace
      multiple glyphs with a single one, for instance) and its visual appearance by e.g.
      attaching marks to letters. This is the meat of text shaping.

      OpenType rules have limitations, though. They don't work with mixed direction text,
      because, when going from one text direction to the other, there is a visual jump that
      breaks pattern matching.

      To illustrate, the logical string "0123456789" might have a display order like this:

      01234  765  89
      ^LTR   ^RTL ^LTR continued

      As you can see, there is a visual jump from 4 all the way to 5, and similarly from
      7 to 8.
      This kind of discontinuity cannot work with OpenType rules, which want to work with
      "neighboring" glyphs in the visual sense.

      OpenType rules don't work with mixed script text, either. They are designed to work with
      a single writing system, and ideally a single language. A typographic rule that is correct
      in writing system A might not be in writing system B, and vice versa.

      So, for all of these reasons, we need to split our text before sending it to the shaper.
      This is what the text processing pipeline looks like:

       Your text       A        Text runs with         B       Sequence of glyphs      C
       (Probably ------------> uniform direction ------------> ready to rasterize ------------> Pixels
        UTF-8)                    and script

      We call arrow A text segmentation, arrow B text shaping, and arrow C rasterization.
      This library does A and B.

    FEATURE OVERVIEW
      This library provides:
      - Unicode segmentation
          LTR/RTL breaking
          Script breaking
          Line breaking
          Word breaking
          Grapheme breaking
      - OpenType text shaping
          Open and parse TTF and OTF fonts
          Apply OpenType features such as ligatures and contextual typographic rules
          All OpenType shapers are supported, which means most languages in the world are supported
            (see LANGUAGE_SUPPORT for known non-supported cases)

    COMPILING & LINKING
      This library uses declare-anywhere, so it will not compile as C89/VC6 C.

      In one C/C++ file that #includes this file, do this:
        #define KB_TEXT_SHAPE_IMPLEMENTATION
      before the #include. That will create the implementation in that file.

      If you also do this:
        #define KB_TEXT_SHAPE_STATIC
      then all functions will be declared as static.

      If you do this:
        #define KB_TEXT_SHAPE_NO_CRT
      then we do not use the C runtime library.
      In that case, these functions are compiled out:
        kbts_ShapePushFontFromFile()
        kbts_FontFromFile()
      Additionally, there are some functions that you will want to #define yourself:
        KBTS_MEMSET
          defaults to memset otherwise.
        KBTS_MEMCPY
          defaults to memcpy otherwise.
      You can redefine the default allocator by redefining these:
        KBTS_MALLOC(AllocatorData, Size)
          defaults to 0 if KB_TEXT_SHAPE_NO_CRT is defined,
          defaults to malloc(Size) otherwise.
        KBTS_FREE(AllocatorData, Pointer)
          defaults to a no-op if KB_TEXT_SHAPE_NO_CRT is defined,
          defaults to free(Pointer) otherwise.
      In other words,
      if you do not redefine the default allocator, and you #define KB_TEXT_SHAPE_NO_CRT,
      then the default allocator always returns 0.

    EXAMPLES
      Basic
        kbts_shape_context *Context = kbts_CreateShapeContext(0, 0);
        kbts_ShapePushFontFromFile(Context, "myfont.ttf", 0);

        kbts_ShapeBegin(Context, KBTS_DIRECTION_DONT_KNOW, KBTS_LANGUAGE_DONT_KNOW);
        kbts_ShapeUtf8(Context, "Let's shape something!", sizeof("Let's shape something!") - 1, KBTS_USER_ID_GENERATION_MODE_CODEPOINT_INDEX);
        kbts_ShapeEnd(Context);

        // Layout runs naively left to right.
        kbts_run Run;
        int CursorX = 0, CursorY = 0;
        while(kbts_ShapeRun(Context, &Run))
        {
          kbts_glyph *Glyph;
          while(kbts_GlyphIteratorNext(&Run.Glyphs, &Glyph))
          {
            int GlyphX = CursorX + Glyph->OffsetX;
            int GlyphY = CursorY + Glyph->OffsetY;

            DisplayGlyph(Glyph->Id, GlyphX, GlyphY);

            CursorX += Glyph->AdvanceX;
            CursorY += Glyph->AdvanceY;
          }
        }

      Font collections
        void *FontData;
        int FontSize;
        kbts_font Font = kbts_FontFromFile("myfonts.ttc", 0, 0, 0, &FontData, &FontSize);

        kbts_ShapePushFont(Context, &Font);

        int FontCount = kbts_FontCount(FontData, FontSize);
        for(int FontIndex = 1; FontIndex < FontCount; ++FontIndex)
        {
          kbts_ShapePushFontFromMemory(Context, FontData, FontSize, FontIndex);
        }

      Feature control
        kbts_ShapeBegin(Context, KBTS_DIRECTION_DONT_KNOW, KBTS_LANGUAGE_DONT_KNOW);

        kbts_ShapePushFeature(Context, KBTS_FEATURE_TAG_kern, 0);
        kbts_ShapeUtf8(Context, "Without kerning", sizeof("Without kerning") - 1, KBTS_USER_ID_GENERATION_MODE_CODEPOINT_INDEX);
        kbts_ShapePopFeature(Context, KBTS_FEATURE_TAG_kern);

        kbts_ShapeUtf8(Context, "With kerning", sizeof("With kerning") - 1, KBTS_USER_ID_GENERATION_MODE_CODEPOINT_INDEX);

        kbts_ShapeEnd(Context);

    API
      The shaping API is broken down into two parts: the context API and the direct API.

      The context API is the higher-level API of the two and is meant to be the default
      API.
      It exposes an immediate-mode, procedural interface somewhat inspired by Dear Imgui
      and covers most of the functionality present in the library. It notably includes
      automatic segmentation into paragraphs and runs, shaping, and font fallback.

      The direct API, in contrast, is all of the tools you can use to directly manage and
      manipulate shaping data. With it, you can interact directly with the lower-level
      parts of the library, giving you very granular control. It is also very explicit
      about memory. As a result, it is also a lot more verbose than the context API.

      The library also contains several miscellaneous utility functions that are not
      obviously part of any of the two aforementioned APIs.


      In the documentation below, all functions (as well as some structs/enums) are
      marked with "search tags".
      As an example, this hypothetical function:

        int kbts_Foo(int X);

      Will be presented like this:

        :kbts_Foo
        :Foo
        int kbts_Foo(int X);

      Allowing you to easily search for its documentation by searching for either ":Foo"
      or ":kbts_Foo".

      MEMORY MANAGEMENT
        kb_text_shape takes manual memory management seriously, and tries to give the user as much
        control over memory as possible.

        Whenever it is possible for you to pass your own buffer into a function, we allow it.
        Whenever it is not possible, we allow specifying a custom allocator.
        An allocator is simply a function that manages memory:

          :kbts_allocator_function
          :allocator_function
          typedef void kbts_allocator_function(void *Data, kbts_allocator_op *Op);
            [Data] the custom data pointer you passed in along with your allocator.
            [Op]   the memory request. It is of this type:

              :kbts_allocator_op
              :allocator_op
              typedef struct kbts_allocator_op
              {
                kbts_allocator_op_kind Kind;

                union
                {
                  kbts_allocator_op_allocate Allocate;
                  kbts_allocator_op_free Free;
                };
              } kbts_allocator_op;

            And the possible op kinds are:
              KBTS_ALLOCATOR_OP_KIND_ALLOCATE
              KBTS_ALLOCATOR_OP_KIND_FREE

            ALLOCATE expects you to fill in Op->Allocate.Pointer.
              The allocation does not need to be aligned.
            FREE expects you to free Op->Free.Pointer.

      THE CONTEXT API
        CONTEXT:CREATION
          :kbts_SizeOfShapeContext
          :SizeOfShapeContext
          int kbts_SizeOfShapeContext()
            Tells you how big of a buffer you need to provide to kbts_PlaceShapeContext.

          :kbts_PlaceShapeContext
          :PlaceShapeContext
          kbts_shape_context *kbts_PlaceShapeContext(kbts_allocator_function *Allocator, void *AllocatorData, void *Memory)
            Places a context at Memory and initializes it.
            [Allocator] will be used for subsequent allocations.

          :kbts_PlaceShapeContextFixedMemory
          :PlaceShapeContextFixedMemory
          kbts_shape_context *kbts_PlaceShapeContextFixedMemory(void *Memory, int Size)
            Places a context at Memory and initializes it.
            This context will only use the [Size] bytes located at [Memory] for its allocations.

          :kbts_CreateShapeContext
          :CreateShapeContext
          kbts_shape_context *kbts_CreateShapeContext(kbts_allocator_function *Allocator, void *AllocatorData)
            Allocates a context using [Allocator] and initializes it.

          :kbts_DestroyShapeContext
          :DestroyShapeContext
          void kbts_DestroyShapeContext(kbts_shape_context *Context)
            Frees all context memory.
            If the Context was allocated by kbts_CreateShapeContext, then it is also freed.

        CONTEXT:FONT HANDLING
          The context is capable of managing multiple fonts through a font stack.
          The font stack will hold references to all fonts in use by the context. Whenever
          you try to shape some text, the context will check to see if it is supported by
          the font at the top of the stack. If it is not, it will try the next font down,
          and so on, until all fonts have been tried. As such, you should push your fallback
          fonts first, and your preferred fonts last.

          :kbts_ShapePushFontFromFile
          :ShapePushFontFromFile
          kbts_font *kbts_ShapePushFontFromFile(kbts_shape_context *Context, const char *FileName, int FontIndex)
            (This function is not available if KB_TEXT_SHAPE_NO_CRT is defined.)

            Opens the file corresponding to [FileName], parses the [FontIndex]th font
            within it, and, if successful, pushes the result onto the stack.

            A [return value] of 0 could mean that the stack is out of space (see
            KBTS_CONTEXT_MAX_FONT_COUNT), that the file could not be found or opened,
            or that the parse has failed.

          :kbts_ShapePushFontFromMemory
          :ShapePushFontFromMemory
          kbts_font *kbts_ShapePushFontFromMemory(kbts_shape_context *Context, void *Memory, int Size, int FontIndex)
            Parses the [FontIndex]th font in [Memory] and pushes the result to the font
            stack.

            A [return value] of 0 could mean that the stack is out of space (see
            KBTS_CONTEXT_MAX_FONT_COUNT) or that the font could not be parsed.

          :kbts_ShapePushFont
          :ShapePushFont
          kbts_font *kbts_ShapePushFont(kbts_shape_context *Context, kbts_font *Font)
            Pushes the pre-parsed [Font] onto the stack.

            A [return value] of 0 means that the stack has run out of space (see
            KBTS_CONTEXT_MAX_FONT_COUNT).

          :kbts_ShapePopFont
          :ShapePopFont
          kbts_font *kbts_ShapePopFont(kbts_shape_context *Context)
            Removes the topmost font from the stack.

            A [return value] of 0 means that there is no font to remove.
            A non-null [return value] is the original font pointer that was pushed.

            If the context allocated the font itself, using kbts_ShapePushFontFromFile or
            kbts_ShapePushFontFromMemory, then the pointer is still returned, but it points to
            freed memory.

        CONTEXT:SHAPING
          :kbts_ShapeBegin
          :ShapeBegin
          void kbts_ShapeBegin(kbts_shape_context *Context, kbts_direction ParagraphDirection, kbts_language Language)
            Begins a shaping pass.

            [ParagraphDirection] is sometimes called the "document direction". It can significantly
            affect segmentation. Bidirectionality in text works like a stack: the default direction
            is at the bottom of the stack, and, sometimes, text can _temporarily_ take a different
            direction. In the end, though, it will always go back to the document direction.

            To illustrate, a period followed by a space ". " typically ends up resetting the current
            direction to the paragraph direction. This means that, if my paragraph direction is
            left-to-right, and I am shaping Arabic text, then each Arabic sentence will be
            right-to-left, but the sentences themselves will be sequenced left-to-right. If
            [ParagraphDirection] is KBTS_DIRECTION_DONT_KNOW, then the context takes the first
            directional hint in the text as the paragraph direction.

            [Language] is used to select which font rules are used. Knowing this allows access to
            language-specific typographical features. If [Language] is KBTS_LANGUAGE_DONT_KNOW, then
            the default, language-agnostic font rules are used.

          :kbts_ShapeEnd
          :ShapeEnd
          void kbts_ShapeEnd(kbts_shape_context *Context)
            Ends a shaping pass.

            This means you are done providing input to the context, and, in turn, that
            you can start getting results from it with kbts_ShapeRun().

          :kbts_ShapeRun
          :ShapeRun
          int kbts_ShapeRun(kbts_shape_context *Context, kbts_run *Run)
            Once you've called kbts_ShapeEnd, you can get the resulting runs by calling this
            function repeatedly.

            !!! CAREFUL !!! Memory is reused from one run to the next, so you cannot
            trivially store [Run] and reuse it later. Instead, you should traverse the
            glyphs using the iterator provided in Run.Glyphs and extract whatever data
            you need before calling kbts_ShapeRun again.

            The [return value] is non-zero if a run was shaped.
            When there is no text left to shape, the [return value] is 0.

              kbts_ShapeEnd(Context);
              kbts_run Run;
              while(kbts_ShapeRun(Context, &Run))
              {
                // Handle Run
              }

          :kbts_ShapePushFeature
          :ShapePushFeature
          void kbts_ShapePushFeature(kbts_shape_context *Context, kbts_u32 FeatureTag, int Value)
            The context has a feature stack that allows you to manipulate font features hierarchically.
            When you give text to the context, it will apply all feature overrides that are on the
            stack at the time.
            If two feature overrides use the same tag, then only the latest one, i.e. the one higher
            in the stack, is applied.

          :kbts_ShapePopFeature
          :ShapePopFeature
          int kbts_ShapePopFeature(kbts_shape_context *Context, kbts_u32 FeatureTag)
            Removes the latest feature override with tag [FeatureTag].
            The [return value] is non-zero if an override was found and removed, 0 if not.

          :kbts_ShapeCodepointWithUserId
          :ShapeCodepointWithUserId
          void kbts_ShapeCodepointWithUserId(kbts_shape_context *Context, int Codepoint, int UserId)
            Inputs a codepoint to shape.
            [Codepoint] is a Unicode codepoint.
            [UserId] is an arbitrary identifier that you will get back when reading the results.
            This is often some kind of index into the input text so that you can perform hit-testing.
            If an automatic codepoint index is fine for you, consider using kbts_ShapeCodepoint.

          :kbts_ShapeCodepoint
          :ShapeCodepoint
          void kbts_ShapeCodepoint(kbts_shape_context *Context, int Codepoint)
            Inputs a codepoint to shape.

            The codepoint's user ID will be an implicit codepoint index assigned by the
            context.

          :kbts_ShapeUtf32WithUserId
          :ShapeUtf32WithUserId
          void kbts_ShapeUtf32WithUserId(kbts_shape_context *Context,
                                         int *Utf32, int Length,
                                         int UserId, int UserIdIncrement);
            Inputs a block of UTF-32 text to shape.

            User IDs for each codepoint start at [UserId] and increment by [UserIdIncrement]
            for every codepoint.

          :kbts_ShapeUtf32
          :ShapeUtf32
          void kbts_ShapeUtf32(kbts_shape_context *Context, int *Utf32, int Length)
            Same as kbts_ShapeUtf8WithUserId, but using the context's implicit user ID counter.

          :kbts_ShapeUtf8WithUserId
          :ShapeUtf8WithUserId
          void kbts_ShapeUtf8WithUserId(kbts_shape_context *Context,
                                        const char *Utf8, int Length,
                                        int UserId, kbts_user_id_generation_mode UserIdGenerationMode);
            Inputs a block of UTF-8 text to shape.

            User IDs for the corresponding codepoints start at [UserId].
            If [UserIdGenerationMode] is KBTS_USER_ID_GENERATION_MODE_CODEPOINT_INDEX,
            each codepoint will increment the user ID by 1.
            If [UserIdGenerationMode] is KBTS_USER_ID_GENERATION_MODE_CODEPOINT_INDEX,
            each codepoint will increment the user ID by the length of its encoding in
            UTF-8.

          :kbts_ShapeUtf8
          :ShapeUtf8
          void kbts_ShapeUtf8(kbts_shape_context *Context,
                              const char *Utf8, int Length,
                              kbts_user_id_generation_mode UserIdGenerationMode)
            Same as kbts_ShapeUtf8WithUserId, but using the context's implicit user ID
            counter.

            User IDs for the corresponding codepoints start at the context's implicit
            user ID counter.
            If [UserIdGenerationMode] is KBTS_USER_ID_GENERATION_MODE_CODEPOINT_INDEX,
            each codepoint will increment the user ID by 1.
            If [UserIdGenerationMode] is KBTS_USER_ID_GENERATION_MODE_CODEPOINT_INDEX,
            each codepoint will increment the user ID by the length of its encoding in
            bytes in UTF-8.

          :kbts_ShapeCurrentCodepointsIterator
          :ShapeCurrentCodepointsIterator
          kbts_shape_codepoint_iterator kbts_ShapeCurrentCodepointsIterator(kbts_shape_context *Context)
            The [return value] is an iterator that goes over all of the codepoints fed to
            [Context] so far.

            These codepoints are tagged with user IDs, segmentation info and more. See
            the definition of kbts_shape_codepoint for details.

            !!! WARNING !!!
              Remember that segmentation is buffered, so, until you call kbts_ShapeEnd,
              some codepoints might not be completely filled in yet!

            Call kbts_ShapeCodepointIteratorNext repeatedly to loop through the
            corresponding codepoints.

          :kbts_ShapeCodepointIteratorIsValid
          :ShapeCodepointIteratorIsValid
          int kbts_ShapeCodepointIteratorIsValid(kbts_shape_codepoint_iterator *It)
            The [return value] is non-zero if there is still a codepoint to iterate,
            zero if not.

          :kbts_ShapeCodepointIteratorNext
          :ShapeCodepointIteratorNext
          int kbts_ShapeCodepointIteratorNext(kbts_shape_codepoint_iterator *It, kbts_shape_codepoint *Codepoint, int *CodepointIndex)
            Gets the next codepoint from the context [It] was initialized from and writes
            it to [Codepoint].

            If [CodepointIndex] is non-zero, then it is filled with [Codepoint]'s index.

            The [return value] is non-zero if a codepoint was found, 0 if not.

          :kbts_ShapeGetShapeCodepoint
          :ShapeGetShapeCodepoint
          int kbts_ShapeGetShapeCodepoint(kbts_shape_context *Context, int CodepointIndex, kbts_shape_codepoint *Codepoint)
            Gets the [CodepointIndex]th codepoint from [Context] and writes it to
            [Codepoint].

            If you are reading glyphs back from the context, then you can use the
            UserIdOrCodepointIndex field of kbts_glyph here.

            !!! WARNING !!!
            When using the context API, UserIdOrCodepointIndex will _always_ be a
            codepoint index. To get your original user ID, you need to do:

              kbts_shape_codepoint ShapeCodepoint;
              kbts_ShapeGetShapeCodepoint(Context, Glyph->UserIdOrCodepointIndex, &ShapeCodepoint);
              int MyUserId = ShapeCodepoint.UserId;

            The [return value] is non-zero if [CodepointIndex] is in-bounds, 0 if not.

        CONTEXT:MISCELLANEOUS
          :kbts_ShapeError
          :ShapeError
          kbts_shape_error kbts_ShapeError(kbts_shape_context *Context);
            Get the first error that occurred on [Context].

            Once a context is tagged with an error, most operations on it will do nothing.
            Obviously, you can always destroy it.

          :kbts_ShapeManualBreak
          :ShapeManualBreak
          void kbts_ShapeManualBreak(kbts_shape_context *Context);
            Forces a run break at the current position in the Context.

            This will flush the current segmentation state just like an end-of-text would,
            and restart it as if it was at a start-of-text.

            This will also generate a KBTS_BREAK_FLAG_MANUAL at the current position.

            You do not need to be in manual break mode for this function to work.

          :kbts_ShapeBeginManualRuns
          :ShapeBeginManualRuns
          void kbts_ShapeBeginManualRuns(kbts_shape_context *Context);
            Disables the context's automatic segmentation, and enters a manual break mode.

          :kbts_ShapeNextManualRun
          :ShapeNextManualRun
          void kbts_ShapeNextManualRun(kbts_shape_context *Context, kbts_direction Direction, kbts_script Script);
            Add a run break at the current place in the input stream.

            Since the context's segmentation is disabled, it cannot know which direction
            and script to use, so you need to provide them with [Direction] and [Script].

            Outside of manual break mode, this function is a no-op.

          :kbts_ShapeEndManualRuns
          :ShapeEndManualRuns
          void kbts_ShapeEndManualRuns(kbts_shape_context *Context);
            Ends manual break mode and re-enables the context's automatic segmentation.

            Note that this will force natural break barriers too, just like an end-of-text
            would.

            Outside of manual break mode, this function is a no-op.

      DIRECT SHAPING API
        When trying to shape things yourself, there are four main pieces of state you will need:
        - Font data (kbts_font)
        - A shaping configuration (kbts_shape_config)
            A shaping configuration holds a bunch of precomputed data for a given combination of
            font, script and language.
            You can think of it as a pipeline state in a modern graphics API.
            In practice, you are only ever shaping text with a single active configuration.
        - Glyph storage (kbts_glyph_storage)
            Glyph storage fills two roles: it allocates and holds glyph data, and it also manages
            a set of active glyphs.
            The active glyph set part is used by the library. As a user, you only need to care
            about the memory allocation part.
        - Scratch memory
            Unfortunately, shaping can have a very unpredictable memory footprint, so all shaping
            operations require some amount of scratch space that we cannot compute beforehand.

        The central function to call is this:

          :kbts_ShapeDirect
          :ShapeDirect
          kbts_shape_error kbts_ShapeDirect(kbts_shape_config *Config, kbts_glyph_storage *Storage,
                                            kbts_direction RunDirection,
                                            kbts_allocator_function *Allocator, void *AllocatorData,
                                            kbts_glyph_iterator *Output)
            [RunDirection] is the direction of the specific run being shaped.
            If the [return value] is KBTS_SHAPE_ERROR_NONE, then the shaping operation
            completed successfully.

            Shaping output is returned in [Output]. You can go through the resulting glyphs
            with kbts_GlyphIteratorNext.

            Note that kbts_ShapeDirect does not care about the paragraph direction.
            Glyphs are always returned in left-to-right order. In other words, RTL runs
            are flipped so that visual order is consistent.


          :kbts_ShapeDirectFixedMemory
          :ShapeDirectFixedMemory
          kbts_shape_error kbts_ShapeDirectFixedMemory(kbts_shape_config *Config, kbts_glyph_storage *Storage,
                                                       kbts_direction RunDirection,
                                                       void *Memory, int Size,
                                                       kbts_glyph_iterator *Output)
            Same as kbts_ShapeDirect, but only uses the [Size] bytes at [Memory] for allocations.

        The rest of the direct API is more or less about preparing the data you need to call
        kbts_ShapeDirect.

        DIRECT:FONT HANDLING
          :kbts_FontCount
          :FontCount
          int kbts_FontCount(void *Data, int Size)
            Parses the beginning of the file and returns the number of fonts contained
            within the file data.

            While most font files contain single fonts, font collections contain
            several. This function will return 0 if [Data] is invalid, 1 if it represents
            a single font, and possibly more if it represents a collection.

            For all functions that require a font index, passing 0 is always safe no
            matter the kind of file.

          :kbts_FontFromFile
          :FontFromFile
          kbts_font kbts_FontFromFile(const char *FileName, int FontIndex,
                                      kbts_allocator_function *Allocator, void *AllocatorData,
                                      void **FileData, int *FileSize)
            (This function is not available if KB_TEXT_SHAPE_NO_CRT is defined.)
            Opens the file at [FileName], parses it and returns the [FontIndex]th font.
            You can call kbts_FontIsValid to check if the [return value] is usable.

            If [FileData] is non-zero, it is filled with a pointer to the file's contents.
            This pointer is allocated using [Allocator]. If [FileData] is 0, it is freed
            before the function returns.
            If [FileSize] is non-zero, it is filled with the size of the file's contents.

            If [FontIndex] is out of range, the [return value] is invalid.

          :kbts_FontFromMemory
          :FontFromMemory
          kbts_font kbts_FontFromMemory(void *FileData, int FileSize, int FontIndex,
                                        kbts_allocator_function *Allocator, void *AllocatorData)
            Parses the [FontIndex]th font in [FileData].
            You can call kbts_FontIsValid to check if the [return value] is usable.

          :kbts_FontIsValid
          :FontIsValid
          int kbts_FontIsValid(kbts_font *Font)
            Returns whether a font is usable.

          :kbts_LoadFont
          :LoadFont
          kbts_load_font_error kbts_LoadFont(kbts_font *Font, kbts_load_font_state *State,
                                             void *FontData, int FontDataSize, int FontIndex,
                                             int *ScratchSize, int *OutputSize)
            Parses the [FontIndex]th font in [FontData] and puts the result into [Font] and [State].

            [State] needs to be zeroed before calling this function.

            If the data represents a TrueType/OpenType font, we need to extract the data
            we need and create some additional data structures. In this case, the [return
            value] is KBTS_LOAD_FONT_ERROR_NEED_TO_CREATE_BLOB, and [ScratchSize] and
            [OutputSize] are filled with the amount of memory we need to create our
            blob. You can then initialize this blob with kbts_PlaceBlob.

            If the data represents a kbts blob, then nothing needs to be done, and [Font] is
            immediately usable.

            Any value of [FontIndex] less than kbts_FontCount(FontData, FontDataSize) is
            acceptable.

            If we could not find any useful font data, the [return value] is
            KBTS_LOAD_FONT_ERROR_INVALID_FONT.

          :kbts_PlaceBlob
          :PlaceBlob
          kbts_load_font_error kbts_PlaceBlob(kbts_font *Font, kbts_load_font_state *State,
                                              void *ScratchMemory, void *OutputMemory)
            Creates a kbts blob from font data, and places it in [OutputMemory].
            [Font] is the resulting font.
            [State] is the state you passed into kbts_LoadFont.
            [ScratchMemory] needs to be as big as the [ScratchSize] returned by kbts_LoadFont.
            You can free this buffer once this function returns.
            [OutputMemory] needs to be as big as the [OutputSize] returned by kbts_LoadFont.
            This buffer will be used by [Font] until it is freed by kbts_FreeFont.

          :kbts_FreeFont
          :FreeFont
          void kbts_FreeFont(kbts_font *Font)
            If [Font] used allocators to allocate its data (for instance, if [Font] was
            returned by kbts_FontFromFile), frees all of [Font]'s buffers.
            Otherwise, does nothing.

          :kbts_GetFontInfo
          :GetFontInfo
          void kbts_GetFontInfo(kbts_font *Font, kbts_font_info *Info)
            Writes a bunch of useful metadata about [Font] into [Info].
            You can use this function to extract styling, name and licensing information
            from a font.

            We use a simplified representation for font weight and width that is fine for
            classic font selection, e.g. "I need a bold font". OpenType fonts may feature
            finer-grained metrics, and we currently do not expose/support those.

            :kbts_font_style_flags
            :font_style_flags
            [Info]->StyleFlags can be:
              KBTS_FONT_STYLE_FLAG_NONE (no useful style flags have been found)
              KBTS_FONT_STYLE_FLAG_REGULAR
              KBTS_FONT_STYLE_FLAG_BOLD
              KBTS_FONT_STYLE_FLAG_ITALIC
            A given font can be bold and italic at the same time, but probably not regular
            and bold and probably not regular and italic.

            If [Font] is not a valid font, then [Info] will be zeroed.

        DIRECT:SHAPE CONFIG
          :kbts_SizeOfShapeConfig
          :SizeOfShapeConfig
          int kbts_SizeOfShapeConfig(kbts_font *Font, kbts_script Script, kbts_language Language)
            Returns how large the buffer you pass into kbts_PlaceShapeConfig needs to be.

          :kbts_PlaceShapeConfig
          :PlaceShapeConfig
          kbts_shape_config *kbts_PlaceShapeConfig(kbts_font *Font, kbts_script Script, kbts_language Language,
                                                   void *Memory)
            Writes a shape config into [Memory] and returns a pointer to it.
            [Memory] needs to be at least kbts_SizeOfShapeConfig([Font], [Script], [Language]) bytes.

          :kbts_CreateShapeConfig
          :CreateShapeConfig
          kbts_shape_config *kbts_CreateShapeConfig(kbts_font *Font, kbts_script Script, kbts_language Language,
                                                    kbts_allocator_function *Allocator, void *AllocatorData)
            Allocates and initializes a shape config.

          :kbts_DestroyShapeConfig
          :DestroyShapeConfig
          void kbts_DestroyShapeConfig(kbts_shape_config *Config)
            If [Config] was allocated in kbts_CreateShapeConfig, frees all of [Config]'s data.
            Otherwise, nothing is done.

        DIRECT:GLYPH STORAGE
          kbts_glyph_storage is a public struct:

            :kbts_glyph_storage
            :glyph_storage
            typedef struct kbts_glyph_storage
            {
              kbts_arena Arena;

              kbts_glyph GlyphSentinel;
              kbts_glyph FreeGlyphSentinel;
            } kbts_glyph_storage;

          A zeroed kbts_glyph_storage will auto-initialize itself when you try to use it.

          Arena requires an allocator. By default, it will be initialized to KBTS_MALLOC
          and KBTS_FREE.
          You can specify your own allocator by writing to Arena.Allocator and
          Arena.AllocatorData before trying to use a kbts_glyph_storage.
          Alternatively, you can use kbts_InitializeGlyphStorage() to accomplish the
          same thing.

          :kbts_InitializeGlyphStorage
          :InitializeGlyphStorage
          int kbts_InitializeGlyphStorage(kbts_glyph_storage *Storage, kbts_allocator_function *Allocator, void *AllocatorData)
            Initializes [Storage] to use [Allocator] and [AllocatorData].

            This is equivalent to setting [Storage]->Arena.Allocator and
            [Storage]->Arena.AllocatorData, and setting all other members to 0.

            The [return value] is non-zero if [Storage] is non-null.

          :kbts_InitializeGlyphStorageFixedMemory
          :InitializeGlyphStorageFixedMemory
          int kbts_InitializeGlyphStorageFixedMemory(kbts_glyph_storage *Storage, void *Memory, int MemorySize)
            Initializes [Storage] to use a fixed-size buffer of size [MemorySize] located at [Memory].
            If [Storage] needs more memory than [MemorySize], allocations will fail.

            The [return value] is non-zero if [Storage] is non-null and [MemorySize] is
            large enough to initialize [Storage]'s arena. (Currently, this is 5 pointers'
            worth of bytes.)

          :kbts_PushGlyph
          :PushGlyph
          kbts_glyph *kbts_PushGlyph(kbts_glyph_storage *Storage,
                                     kbts_font *Font, int Codepoint, kbts_glyph_config *Config, int UserId)
            Adds a glyph to [Storage]'s active glyph set and returns a pointer to it.

            [Font] is used to initialize the glyph's glyph ID. It is assumed that [Font] is
            the same as the kbts_shape_config's Font field passed into kbts_ShapeDirect.

            [Config] is the glyph's configuration and needs to stay live until kbts_ShapeDirect
            completes. See DIRECT:GLYPH CONFIG for more details.

            [UserId] is a user-provided unique identifier that you can get back once shaping
            is done.

            The [return value] might be zero if [Storage]'s allocator fails.

          :kbts_ClearActiveGlyphs
          :ClearActiveGlyphs
          void kbts_ClearActiveGlyphs(kbts_glyph_storage *Storage)
            Clears [Storage]'s active glyph set.
            This does not free any memory; rather, it puts the active glyphs in a free list.

          :kbts_FreeAllGlyphs
          :FreeAllGlyphs
          void kbts_FreeAllGlyphs(kbts_glyph_storage *Storage)
            Frees all memory allocated by [Storage].

          :kbts_CodepointToGlyph
          :CodepointToGlyph
          kbts_glyph kbts_CodepointToGlyph(kbts_font *Font, int Codepoint, kbts_glyph_config *Config, int UserId)
            You can create glyphs without a glyph storage at all with this function.

          :kbts_CodepointToGlyphId
          :CodepointToGlyphId
          int kbts_CodepointToGlyphId(kbts_font *Font, int Codepoint)
            Gets the glyph ID corresponding to [Codepoint] from [Font].
            A glyph ID of 0 means that the codepoint is not present in the font.
            Note that this is not thorough enough to be a good font coverage test!
            See OTHER:FONT COVERAGE TEST for this.

          :kbts_ActiveGlyphIterator
          :ActiveGlyphIterator
          kbts_glyph_iterator kbts_ActiveGlyphIterator(kbts_glyph_storage *Storage)
            Returns an iterator to traverse [Storage]'s active glyph set.

            See OTHER:GLYPH ITERATION for more details on glyph iterators.

        DIRECT:GLYPH CONFIG
          The shaper figures out most of the work it needs to do based on the writing system
          it is shaping.

          However, some fonts support optional, toggleable features, like "make this text
          smallcaps". For things like this, you will want to create a kbts_glyph_config.
          You can then pass it to glyph creation functions or write it to the Config field
          of a kbts_glyph.

          A kbts_glyph_config can hold any number of feature overrides. A feature override
          is a feature tag and a value. Most of the time, you only care whether the value
          is 0 or 1, but a few features actually care about the exact value. (You can think
          of a feature that is like "when I am enabled, change this letter to one of these
          alternatives". In that case, the value you provide in the feature override is used
          as an index into the array of alternatives.)

          :kbts_SizeOfGlyphConfig
          :SizeOfGlyphConfig
          int kbts_SizeOfGlyphConfig(kbts_feature_override *Overrides, int OverrideCount)
            Returns the buffer size needed to hold a kbts_glyph_config that describes [Overrides].
            This size can vary a lot depending on the kind of feature overrides you specify.
            Built-in OpenType features with values of 0 or 1 are "free"; they are packed in a
            fixed-size representation which does not change the config's memory footprint.
            On the other hand, if you need non-binary values, or non-standard features, then
            we need to store a description of the override itself, which requires memory.

          :kbts_PlaceGlyphConfig
          :PlaceGlyphConfig
          kbts_glyph_config *kbts_PlaceGlyphConfig(kbts_feature_override *Overrides, int OverrideCount, void *Memory)
            Writes a kbts_glyph_config that describes [Overrides] into [Memory], and returns a
            pointer to it.
            The kbts_glyph_config uses its own representation for overrides, so you can modify
            [Overrides] once this function returns.

          :kbts_CreateGlyphConfig
          :CreateGlyphConfig
          kbts_glyph_config *kbts_CreateGlyphConfig(kbts_feature_override *Overrides, int OverrideCount, kbts_allocator_function *Allocator, void *AllocatorData)
            Allocates a kbts_glyph_config that describes [Overrides] and returns a pointer to
            it.
            The kbts_glyph_config uses its own representation for overrides, so you can modify
            [Overrides] once this function returns.

          :kbts_DestroyGlyphConfig
          :DestroyGlyphConfig
          void kbts_DestroyGlyphConfig(kbts_glyph_config *Config)
            If [Config] was allocated in kbts_CreateGlyphConfig, frees all of its data.
            Otherwise, does nothing.

        DIRECT:SEGMENTATION
          kbts_break_state is the central struct used for segmentation. It contains all of the state
          needed to perform fixed-memory segmentation of text.

          :kbts_BreakBegin
          :BreakBegin
          void kbts_BreakBegin(kbts_break_state *State,
                               kbts_direction ParagraphDirection,
                               kbts_japanese_line_break_style JapaneseLineBreakStyle,
                               kbts_break_config_flags ConfigFlags)
            Initializes [State] for segmentation.

            [ParagraphDirection] is the top-level flow direction of your document or layout.
            If [ParagraphDirection] is KBTS_DIRECTION_DONT_KNOW, then [State]'s
            ParagraphDirection will be initialized to the first direction we find
            while segmenting.

            :kbts_japanese_line_break_style
            :japanese_line_break_style
            [JapaneseLineBreakStyle] can be one of the following:

              KBTS_JAPANESE_LINE_BREAK_STYLE_STRICT
              KBTS_JAPANESE_LINE_BREAK_STYLE_NORMAL
              KBTS_JAPANESE_LINE_BREAK_STYLE_LOOSE

            Japanese text contains "kinsoku" characters, around which breaking a line is
            forbidden. Exactly which characters are "kinsoku" or not depends on the context:

            - Strict style has the largest amount of kinsoku characters, which leads to
              longer lines.
                The Unicode standard does not define what strict style is used for.
                Supposedly, it is used for anything that does not fall into the other
                two categories of text.

            - Loose style has the smallest amount of kinsoku characters, which leads
              to smaller lines.
                According to the Unicode standard, loose style is used for newspapers.
                I assume it is also used for any other narrow column format.

            - Normal style is somewhere in the middle.
                According to the Unicode standard, normal style is used for books and
                documents.

            Note that, while the Unicode standard mentions all three of these styles, it
            does not mention any differences between the normal and loose styles. As such,
            normal and loose styles currently behave the same.

            :kbts_kbts_break_config_flags
            :kbts_break_config_flags
            [ConfigFlags] can be a combination of the following:

              KBTS_BREAK_CONFIG_FLAG_END_OF_TEXT_GENERATES_HARD_LINE_BREAK
                The Unicode standard specifies that the end of a text should generate a
                hard line break. However, this is an awkward rule to uphold in practical
                contexts, because it makes the case where the text ends in a newline
                ambiguous. So, by default, we disable it.

                Without this flag (default behavior):
                  <start of text>\n<end of text> generates a hard line break at position 1
                  <start of text>A<end of text> generates no hard line break

                With this flag (Unicode behavior):
                  <start of text>\n<end of text> generates a hard line break at position 1
                  <start of text>A<end of text> generates a hard line break at position 1

          :kbts_BreakAddCodepoint
          :BreakAddCodepoint
          void kbts_BreakAddCodepoint(kbts_break_state *State, int Codepoint, int PositionIncrement, int EndOfText)
            Feeds [Codepoint] to [State].

            [PositionIncrement] is used to update an internal cursor and fill out
            kbts_break's Position field. If you only care about codepoint indices, pass
            1. Maybe you want to pass in the number of bytes it took to decode the
            codepoint, though, to be able to directly index UTF-8 text.

            If [EndOfText] is non-zero, kbts_BreakEnd is called after adding [Codepoint].

            Every time you call kbts_BreakAddCodepoint, you need to empty the break
            buffer by calling kbts_Break repeatedly.

          :kbts_BreakEnd
          :BreakEnd
          void kbts_BreakEnd(kbts_break_state *State)
            Flushes all pending breaks and finishes segmentation.

            You then obtain breaks by repeatedly calling kbts_Break, just as you would
            after kbts_BreakAddCodepoint.

          :kbts_Break
          :Break
          int kbts_Break(kbts_break_state *State, kbts_break *Break)
            If any breaks have been found, writes one to [Break] and returns a non-zero
            value. If not, returns 0.

            kbts_break looks like this:

              typedef struct kbts_break
              {
                int Position;
                kbts_break_flags Flags;
                kbts_direction Direction; // Only valid if (Flags & KBTS_BREAK_FLAG_DIRECTION).
                kbts_script Script;       // Only valid if (Flags & KBTS_BREAK_FLAG_SCRIPT).
              } kbts_break;

            Position is the position of the break, informed by the PositionIncrement
            you passed to kbts_BreakAddCodepoint.

            Flags can be any combination of:
              KBTS_BREAK_FLAG_DIRECTION
                Indicates a change of direction.

              KBTS_BREAK_FLAG_SCRIPT
                Indicates a change of script.

              KBTS_BREAK_FLAG_GRAPHEME
                Indicates the start of a grapheme.
                Unicode describes a grapheme as a visual unit. In practice, you care about
                graphemes for font coverage testing and caret positioning.

                The way you do grapheme-aware font coverage testing is you split your text
                into graphemes, then, for each grapheme, check if it is supported by your
                font. Grapheme boundaries are nice because they group codepoints that may
                want to combine together, but it separates codepoints that probably won't
                recombine, so they work as an synchronization point for font coverage.

                Caret positioning typically works in graphemes, too. When the user presses
                the right arrow, you would go to the next grapheme boundary instead of
                naively going to the next codepoint.

              KBTS_BREAK_FLAG_WORD
                Indicates the start of a word.

              KBTS_BREAK_FLAG_LINE_SOFT
                A soft line break tells you where you are able to break lines.
                In Unicode land, you cannot break a line without one of these!

              KBTS_BREAK_FLAG_LINE_HARD
                A hard line break should always be respected.

              KBTS_BREAK_FLAG_MANUAL
                This is used internally by the kbts_shape_context for manual segmentation.
                (See kbts_ShapeBeginManualRuns for more details.)

            !CAREFUL! For a given break type, breaks are guaranteed to be returned in order.
                      However, there is no such ordering guarantee between different types
                      of breaks. Each type of break is processed separately, and the
                      corresponding Unicode algorithms all require some kind of buffering
                      scheme to work in fixed memory, so, while any given buffer is consistent
                      with itself, we cannot order multiple buffers together.

          :kbts_BreakEntireString
          :BreakEntireString
          void kbts_BreakEntireString(kbts_direction ParagraphDirection,
                                      kbts_japanese_line_break_style JapaneseLineBreakStyle,
                                      kbts_break_config_flags ConfigFlags,
                                      void *Input, int InputSizeInBytes, kbts_text_format InputFormat,
                                      kbts_break *Breaks, int BreakCapacity, int *BreakCount,
                                      kbts_break_flags *BreakFlags, int BreakFlagCapacity, int *BreakFlagCount)
            Goes through the entire buffer at [Input] and finds all breaks.
            [Input] is of type [InputFormat], which can be one of:
              KBTS_TEXT_FORMAT_UTF32
              KBTS_TEXT_FORMAT_UTF8

            Breaks will be written to [Breaks], up to [BreakCapacity]. Regardless of
            whether [BreakCapacity] is large enough or not, the amount of breaks found
            will be written to [BreakCount]. Unlike kbts_Break, here, [Breaks] are
            guaranteed to be ordered.

            [BreakFlags] is a parallel array to the input sequence. If a break is found
            at position X, then BreakFlags[X] will be filled with the appropriate flags,
            up to [BreakFlagCapacity]. Regardless of whether [BreakFlagCapacity] is large
            enough or not, the required capacity is written to [BreakFlagCount].

          :kbts_BreakEntireStringUtf32
          :BreakEntireStringUtf32
          void kbts_BreakEntireStringUtf32(kbts_direction ParagraphDirection,
                                           kbts_japanese_line_break_style JapaneseLineBreakStyle,
                                           kbts_break_config_flags ConfigFlags,
                                           int *Utf32, int Utf32Count,
                                           kbts_break *Breaks, int BreakCapacity, int *BreakCount,
                                           kbts_break_flags *BreakFlags, int BreakFlagCapacity, int *BreakFlagCount)
            Convenience wrapper for kbts_BreakEntireString for UTF-32 text.

          :kbts_BreakEntireStringUtf8
          :BreakEntireStringUtf8
          void kbts_BreakEntireStringUtf8(kbts_direction ParagraphDirection,
                                          kbts_japanese_line_break_style JapaneseLineBreakStyle,
                                          kbts_break_config_flags ConfigFlags,
                                          const char *Utf8, int Utf8Length,
                                          kbts_break *Breaks, int BreakCapacity, int *BreakCount,
                                          kbts_break_flags *BreakFlags, int BreakFlagCapacity, int *BreakFlagCount)
            Convenience wrapper for kbts_BreakEntireString for UTF-8 text.

            This wrapper passes the amount of bytes used to decode each codepoint into
            kbts_BreakAddCodepoint's PositionIncrement argument. This means that break
            positions written to [Breaks] point into the UTF-8 stream.

          :kbts_GuessTextProperties
          :GuessTextProperties
          void kbts_GuessTextProperties(void *Text, int TextSizeInBytes, kbts_text_format Format,
                                        kbts_direction *Direction, kbts_script *Script)
            Goes through the input sequence at [Text], finds the first direction and
            script, and writes them to [Direction] and [Script] respectively.

            This is a quick-and-dirty way of finding out simple facts about your text.
            However, the results only really make sense when you know [Input] is
            mono-script and mono-direction.

          :kbts_GuessTextPropertiesUtf32
          :GuessTextPropertiesUtf32
          void kbts_GuessTextPropertiesUtf32(const int *Utf32, int Utf32Count,
                                             kbts_direction *Direction, kbts_script *Script)
            Convenience wrapper for kbts_GuessTextProperties for UTF-32 text.

          :kbts_GuessTextPropertiesUtf8
          :GuessTextPropertiesUtf8
          void kbts_GuessTextPropertiesUtf8(const char *Utf8, int Utf8Length,
                                            kbts_direction *Direction, kbts_script *Script)
            Convenience wrapper for kbts_GuessTextProperties for UTF-8 text.

      OTHER APIS
        OTHER:GLYPH ITERATION
          :kbts_GlyphIteratorNext
          :GlyphIteratorNext
          int kbts_GlyphIteratorNext(kbts_glyph_iterator *It, kbts_glyph **Glyph)
            Writes the next glyph to iterate over in [Glyph].

            Once shaping is done, the interesting members of a glyph are:
            - Id: the glyph index/id in the font.
            - UserId: the user ID you passed in when creating the glyph.
              This is typically some kind of codepoint index you can use to trace back
              the glyph to your source text.
            - AdvanceX/Y and OffsetX/Y: positioning data.
              Here is how you might use them:

                kbts_glyph *Glyph;
                int CursorX = 0, CursorY = 0;
                while(kbts_GlyphIteratorNext(&It, &Glyph))
                {
                  int GlyphX = CursorX + Glyph->OffsetX;
                  int GlyphY = CursorY + Glyph->OffsetY;

                  CursorX += Glyph->AdvanceX;
                  CursorY += Glyph->AdvanceY;
                }

            You cannot assume that [Glyph] will stay valid if you free its glyph storage,
            begin another shaping operation using the same glyph storage, or do any kind
            of manipulation involving the glyph storage that holds this glyph. Likewise,
            you should probably not assume that [Glyph] will stay valid after the next
            call to kbts_GlyphIteratorNext.

            The [return value] is 1 if we found a glyph to return, and 0 if we did not.
            Once kbts_GlyphIteratorNext has returned 0, you can keep calling it and
            it will keep returning 0.

          :kbts_GlyphIteratorIsValid
          :GlyphIteratorIsValid
          int kbts_GlyphIteratorIsValid(kbts_glyph_iterator *It)
            Returns whether there are still glyphs left to iterate over.

            If this returns a non-zero value, then the next call to
            kbts_GlyphIteratorNext will also return a non-zero value and write a valid
            glyph.

        OTHER:FONT COVERAGE TEST
          To implement font fallback, you need to be able to know if a given span of text
          is supported by a given font. However, this process is not as simple as it sounds.
          Some Unicode codepoints have "canonical decompositions" and "canonical
          recompositions" that are meant to describe different ways to represent the same
          text, but with different codepoints. At the beginning of the shaping process,
          shapers try all combinations until one is found that is fully supported by the
          font. A font coverage test does this within a fixed memory footprint.

          :kbts_FontCoverageTestBegin
          :FontCoverageTestBegin
          void kbts_FontCoverageTestBegin(kbts_font_coverage_test *Test, kbts_font *Font)
            Initializes [Test] to test coverage with [Font].

          :kbts_FontCoverageTestCodepoint
          :FontCoverageTestCodepoint
          void kbts_FontCoverageTestCodepoint(kbts_font_coverage_test *Test, int Codepoint)
            Feeds [Codepoint] into [Test] and updates coverage information.

          :kbts_FontCoverageTestEnd
          :FontCoverageTestEnd
          int kbts_FontCoverageTestEnd(kbts_font_coverage_test *Test)
            Flushes the pending combinations not yet tested by [Test] and ends the coverage
            test.
            The [return value] is non-zero if the text is fully supported by the font,
            whereas it is 0 if any glyph was not supported.
            You can also check Test->Error to see if any glyph was unsupported.

        OTHER:OTHER OTHER:MISC
          :kbts_DecodeUtf8
          :DecodeUtf8
          kbts_decode kbts_DecodeUtf8(const char *Utf8, kbts_un Length)
            Tries to decode a single codepoint from [Utf8].
            kbts_decode looks like this:

              typedef struct kbts_decode
              {
                int Codepoint;

                int SourceCharactersConsumed;
                int Valid;
              } kbts_decode;

            Codepoint is the decoded codepoint.
            SourceCharactersConsumed is the amount of bytes that were read from [Utf8].
            If decoding was successful, Valid is non-zero. Otherwise, it is zero.
            Valid is zero if we run out of characters, or if the characters in [Utf8]
            are invalid.

          :kbts_EncodeUtf8
          :EncodeUtf8
          kbts_encode_utf8 kbts_EncodeUtf8(int Codepoint)
            Tries to encode a single codepoint into a UTF-8 sequence of bytes.
            kbts_encode looks like this:

              typedef struct kbts_encode_utf8
              {
                  char Encoded[4];
                  int EncodedLength;
                  int Valid;
              } kbts_encode_utf8;

            Encoded is the encoded sequence.
            EncodedLength is the number of bytes needed to encode [Codepoint].
            Valid is whether or not [Codepoint] is a valid codepoint to encode.
            (All codepoints up to 0x10FFFF inclusive can be encoded.)
            When Valid is 0, EncodedLength is also 0.

          :kbts_ScriptDirection
          :ScriptDirection
          kbts_direction kbts_ScriptDirection(kbts_script Script)
            Returns the default direction for a given script.

          :kbts_ScriptIsComplex
          :ScriptIsComplex
          int kbts_ScriptIsComplex(kbts_script Script)
            Returns whether a script is complex, i.e. if it requires complex shaper
            support.

          :kbts_ScriptTagToScript
          :ScriptTagToScript
          kbts_script kbts_ScriptTagToScript(kbts_script_tag Tag)
            Returns a given script from a four-character tag.
            A kbts_script_tag can be obtained either through the KBTS_SCRIPT_TAG_*
            constants, or through the KBTS_FOURCC() macro, which creates a tag from
            four characters.

   LANGUAGE SUPPORT
     Shaping is NOT supported for the following scripts:
       Zawgyi: some fonts exist, but no standardized OpenType feature set seems to exist as of writing.
       Syriac: Syriac Abbreviation Mark (0x070F) is not supported.
       Egyptian Hieroglyphs, I think, although example text is hard to come by.
     Word breaking is NOT supported for languages that require word dictionaries, like CJK.

   FONT SUPPORT
     Indic fonts using the Indic1 shaping model are not supported.
       e.g., 'bng2' will work, but 'beng' will not.
       The Indic v2 shaping model was released with OpenType 1.5 in May 2008.
     Traditional Arabic Windows 3.1 fonts are not supported.
       https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/issues/681
     Thai/Lao PUA fonts are not supported.
       These are old fonts that use OS-specific codepages (PUA stands for [Unicode] "Private Use Area") and
       pre-OpenType shaping.
       https://linux.thai.net/~thep/th-otf/shaping.html
     More generally, we try to be compatible with most well-formed fonts, but we try less hard than Harfbuzz
     to be compatible with every font under the sun.

   OTHER LIMITATIONS
     Explicit direction control characters are not supported. This includes:
       0x202A Left-to-right embedding
       0x202B Right-to-left embedding
       0x202D Left-to-right override
       0x202E Right-to-left override
       0x202C Pop directional formatting
       0x2066 Left-to-right isolate
       0x2067 Right-to-left isolate
       0x2068 First strong isolate
       0x2069 Pop directional isolate
     See https://unicode.org/reports/tr9 for more information.

   VERSION HISTORY
     2.05  - Fix custom allocator initialization for kbts_shape_context.PermanentArena.
     2.04  - Fix Indic syllable logic for small/single-character syllables.
             Fix wrong indirection in pointer code in Indic syllable logic.
     2.03  - Fix loading blobs directly, fix a parsing edge case in GPOS format 2 subtables.
     2.02  - Improve globbing of cursive attachments.
     2.01  - Add kbts_InitializeGlyphStorage and kbts_ScriptDirection.
             Rename some private functions for better namespacing.
             Delete some deprecated functions.
             Bounds check in kbts_ScriptIsComplex.
             Fix a couple pointer iteration bugs.
             Fix some pedantic MSVC warnings.
             Extend mirroring logic from brackets to any codepoint that has a Unicode mirror.
     2.0   - Completely new API and implementation.
     1.03  - New functions: kbts_FeatureTagToId(), kbts_FeatureOverrideFromTag(), kbts_EmptyGlyphConfig(), kbts_GlyphConfigOverrideFeature(), kbts_GlyphConfigOverrideFeatureFromTag(), kbts_ScriptTagToScript()
             Unregistered features can now be overriden using their tags.
               This is slower than overriding registered features, i.e. those that have a kbts_feature_id.
             Compiler warning cleanup
     1.02b - Feature control for GPOS features
             Bounds checking in ReadFontHeader
     1.02a - Positioning fix for format 2 GPOS pair adjustments
     1.02  - Added per-glyph manual feature control through kbts_FeatureOverride(), kbts_GlyphConfig()
             Added enum definitions for features cv01-cv99 and ss01-ss20
     1.01  - Header cleanup and glyph output documentation
     1.0   - Initial release

   TODO
     Word dictionaries for word breaking: CJK, etc.
     'stch' feature.

// Unicode defines scripts and languages.
// A language belongs to a single script, and a script belongs to a single writing system.
// On top of these, OpenType defines shapers, which are basically just designations for
// specific code paths that are taken depending on which script is being shapen.
//
// Some scripts, like Latin and Cyrillic, need relatively few operations, while complex
// scripts like Arabic and Indic scripts have specific processing steps that need to happen
// in order to obtain a correct result.
//
// These sequences of operations are _not_ described in the font file itself. The shaping
// code needs to know which script it is shaping, and implement all of those passes itself.
// That is why you, as a user, have to care about this.
//
// When creating shape_config, you can either pass in a known script, or you can specify
// SCRIPT_DONT_KNOW and let the library figure it out.
// While SCRIPT_DONT_KNOW may look appealing, it is worth noting that we can only infer
// the _script_, and not the language, of the text you pass in.
// This means that you might miss out on language-specific features when you use it.

   - Tables are mutually exclusive, except for format 14 which completes the others.
   - 8, 10, 12 > 0, 2, 4, 6
   - Formats 4, 12, 13, 14 are used today.
   -   Formats 4 and 12 are basic cmap tables.
   -   Format 13 is for fallback fonts that want to map lots of codepoints to a few fallback glyphs.
   -   Format 14 is for Unicode Variation Sequences.
   - There can be Unicode and Windows tables with the same formats. In that case, we prefer the Windows tables.
