///////////   THREAD SAFETY

// Individual stb_vorbis* handles are not thread-safe; you cannot decode from
// them from multiple threads at the same time. However, you can have multiple
// stb_vorbis* handles and decode from them independently in multiple thrads.


///////////   MEMORY ALLOCATION

// normally stb_vorbis uses malloc() to allocate memory at startup,
// and alloca() to allocate temporary memory during a frame on the
// stack. (Memory consumption will depend on the amount of setup
// data in the file and how you set the compile flags for speed
// vs. size. In my test files the maximal-size usage is ~150KB.)
//
// You can modify the wrapper functions in the source (setup_malloc,
// setup_temp_malloc, temp_malloc) to change this behavior, or you
// can use a simpler allocation model: you pass in a buffer from
// which stb_vorbis will allocate _all_ its memory (including the
// temp memory). "open" may fail with a VORBIS_outofmem if you
// do not pass in enough data; there is no way to determine how
// much you do need except to succeed (at which point you can
// query get_info to find the exact amount required. yes I know
// this is lame).
//
// If you pass in a non-NULL buffer of the type below, allocation
// will occur from it as described above. Otherwise just pass NULL
// to use malloc()/alloca()

	//
	// Note that on resynch, stb_vorbis will rarely consume all of the buffer,

//     one candidate page, it sees another candidate page. This #define
//     determines how many "overlapping" candidate pages it can search
//     at once. Note that "real" pages are typically ~4KB to ~8KB, whereas
//     garbage pages could be as big as 64KB, but probably average ~16KB.

// FAST_HUFFMAN_LENGTH [number]
//     sets the log size of the huffman-acceleration table.  Maximum
