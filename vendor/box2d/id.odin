/**
 * @defgroup id Ids
 * These ids serve as handles to internal Box2D objects.
 * These should be considered opaque data and passed by value.
 * Include this header if you need the id types and not the whole Box2D API.
 * All ids are considered null if initialized to zero.
 *
 * For example in Odin:
 *
 * @code{.odin}
 * worldId := b2.WorldId{}
 * @endcode
 *
 * This is considered null.
 *
 * @warning Do not use the internals of these ids. They are subject to change. Ids should be treated as opaque objects.
 * @warning You should use ids to access objects in Box2D. Do not access files within the src folder. Such usage is unsupported.
