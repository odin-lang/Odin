	/*
	Initializes a `ma_context_config` object.


	Return Value
	------------
	A `ma_context_config` initialized to defaults.


	Remarks
	-------
	You must always use this to initialize the default state of the `ma_context_config` object. Not using this will result in your program breaking when miniaudio
	is updated and new members are added to `ma_context_config`. It also sets logical defaults.

	You can override members of the returned object by changing it's members directly.

	/*
	Initializes a context.

	The context is used for selecting and initializing an appropriate backend and to represent the backend at a more global level than that of an individual
	device. There is one context to many devices, and a device is created from a context. A context is required to enumerate devices.


	Parameters
	----------
	backends (in, optional)
	    A list of backends to try initializing, in priority order. Can be NULL, in which case it uses default priority order.

	backendCount (in, optional)
	    The number of items in `backend`. Ignored if `backend` is NULL.

	pConfig (in, optional)
	    The context configuration.

	pContext (in)
	    A pointer to the context object being initialized.


	Return Value
	------------
	MA_SUCCESS if successful; any other error code otherwise.


	Thread Safety
	-------------
	Unsafe. Do not call this function across multiple threads as some backends read and write to global state.


	Remarks
	-------
	When `backends` is NULL, the default priority order will be used. Below is a list of backends in priority order:

	The context can be configured via the `pConfig` argument. The config object is initialized with `ma_context_config_init()`. Individual configuration settings
	can then be set directly on the structure. Below are the members of the `ma_context_config` object.

	    pLog
	        A pointer to the `ma_log` to post log messages to. Can be NULL if the application does not
	        require logging. See the `ma_log` API for details on how to use the logging system.

	    threadPriority
	        The desired priority to use for the audio thread. Allowable values include the following:

	        | Thread Priority                      |

	        |--------------------------------------|

	    pUserData
	        A pointer to application-defined data. This can be accessed from the context object directly such as `context.pUserData`.

	    allocationCallbacks
	        Structure containing custom allocation callbacks. Leaving this at defaults will cause it to use MA_MALLOC, MA_REALLOC and MA_FREE. These allocation
	        callbacks will be used for anything tied to the context, including devices.

	    alsa.useVerboseDeviceEnumeration
	        ALSA will typically enumerate many different devices which can be intrusive and not user-friendly. To combat this, miniaudio will enumerate only unique
	        card/device pairs by default. The problem with this is that you lose a bit of flexibility and control. Setting alsa.useVerboseDeviceEnumeration makes
	        it so the ALSA backend includes all devices. Defaults to false.

	    pulse.pApplicationName
	        PulseAudio only. The application name to use when initializing the PulseAudio context with `pa_context_new()`.

	    pulse.pServerName
	        PulseAudio only. The name of the server to connect to with `pa_context_connect()`.

	    pulse.tryAutoSpawn
	        PulseAudio only. Whether or not to try automatically starting the PulseAudio daemon. Defaults to false. If you set this to true, keep in mind that
	        miniaudio uses a trial and error method to find the most appropriate backend, and this will result in the PulseAudio daemon starting which may be
	        intrusive for the end user.

	    coreaudio.sessionCategory
	        iOS only. The session category to use for the shared AudioSession instance. Below is a list of allowable values and their Core Audio equivalents.

	    jack.pClientName
	        The name of the client to pass to `jack_client_open()`.

	    jack.tryStartServer
	        Whether or not to try auto-starting the JACK server. Defaults to false.


	It is recommended that only a single context is active at any given time because it's a bulky data structure which performs run-time linking for the
	relevant backends every time it's initialized.

	The location of the context cannot change throughout it's lifetime. Consider allocating the `ma_context` object with `malloc()` if this is an issue. The
	reason for this is that a pointer to the context is stored in the `ma_device` structure.


	Example 1 - Default Initialization
	----------------------------------
	The example below shows how to initialize the context using the default configuration.

	```c
	ma_context context;
	ma_result result = ma_context_init(NULL, 0, NULL, &context);
	if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
	    // Error.
	}
	```


	Example 2 - Custom Configuration
	--------------------------------
	The example below shows how to initialize the context using custom backend priorities and a custom configuration. In this hypothetical example, the program
	wants to prioritize ALSA over PulseAudio on Linux. They also want to avoid using the WinMM backend on Windows because it's latency is too high. They also
	want an error to be returned if no valid backend is available which they achieve by excluding the Null backend.

	For the configuration, the program wants to capture any log messages so they can, for example, route it to a log file and user interface.

	```c
	ma_backend backends[] = {
	    ma_backend_alsa,
	    ma_backend_pulseaudio,
	    ma_backend_wasapi,
	    ma_backend_dsound
	};

	ma_context_config config = ma_context_config_init();
	config.logCallback = my_log_callback;
	config.pUserData   = pMyUserData;

	ma_context context;
	ma_result result = ma_context_init(backends, sizeof(backends)/sizeof(backends[0]), &config, &context);
	if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
	    // Error.
	    if (result == MA_NO_BACKEND) {
	        // Couldn't find an appropriate backend.
	    }
	}
	```

	/*
	Enumerates over every device (both playback and capture).

	This is a lower-level enumeration function to the easier to use `ma_context_get_devices()`. Use `ma_context_enumerate_devices()` if you would rather not incur
	an internal heap allocation, or it simply suits your code better.

	Note that this only retrieves the ID and name/description of the device. The reason for only retrieving basic information is that it would otherwise require
	opening the backend device in order to probe it for more detailed information which can be inefficient. Consider using `ma_context_get_device_info()` for this,
	but don't call it from within the enumeration callback.

	Returning false from the callback will stop enumeration. Returning true will continue enumeration.


	Parameters
	----------
	pContext (in)
	    A pointer to the context performing the enumeration.

	callback (in)
	    The callback to fire for each enumerated device.

	pUserData (in)
	    A pointer to application-defined data passed to the callback.


	Return Value
	------------
	MA_SUCCESS if successful; any other error code otherwise.


	Thread Safety
	-------------
	Safe. This is guarded using a simple mutex lock.


	Remarks
	-------
	Do _not_ assume the first enumerated device of a given type is the default device.

	Some backends and platforms may only support default playback and capture devices.

	In general, you should not do anything complicated from within the callback. In particular, do not try initializing a device from within the callback. Also,
	do not try to call `ma_context_get_device_info()` from within the callback.

	Consider using `ma_context_get_devices()` for a simpler and safer API, albeit at the expense of an internal heap allocation.

	Retrieves basic information about every active playback and/or capture device.

	This function will allocate memory internally for the device lists and return a pointer to them through the `ppPlaybackDeviceInfos` and `ppCaptureDeviceInfos`

	Parameters
	----------
	pContext (in)
	    A pointer to the context performing the enumeration.

	ppPlaybackDeviceInfos (out)
	    A pointer to a pointer that will receive the address of a buffer containing the list of `ma_device_info` structures for playback devices.

	pPlaybackDeviceCount (out)
	    A pointer to an unsigned integer that will receive the number of playback devices.

	ppCaptureDeviceInfos (out)
	    A pointer to a pointer that will receive the address of a buffer containing the list of `ma_device_info` structures for capture devices.

	pCaptureDeviceCount (out)
	    A pointer to an unsigned integer that will receive the number of capture devices.


	Return Value
	------------

	Thread Safety
	-------------
	Unsafe. Since each call to this function invalidates the pointers from the previous call, you should not be calling this simultaneously across multiple

	Remarks
	-------
	It is _not_ safe to assume the first device in the list is the default device.

	You can pass in NULL for the playback or capture lists in which case they'll be ignored.

	Do _not_ call this from within the `ma_context_enumerate_devices()` callback.

	It's possible for a device to have different information and capabilities depending on whether or not it's opened in shared or exclusive mode. For example, in

	Callback Safety
	---------------
	Safe, but don't try initializing a device in a callback.


	Remarks
	-------
	The returned config will be initialized to defaults. You will normally want to customize a few variables before initializing the device. See Example 1 for a
	typical configuration which sets the sample format, channel count, sample rate, data callback and user data. These are usually things you will want to change
	before initializing the device.

	See `ma_device_init()` for details on specific configuration options.


	Example 1 - Simple Configuration
	--------------------------------
	The example below is what a program will typically want to configure for each device at a minimum. Notice how `ma_device_config_init()` is called first, and
	then the returned object is modified directly. This is important because it ensures that your program continues to work as new configuration options are added
	to the `ma_device_config` structure.

	```c

	device_config_init :: proc(deviceType: device_type) -> device_config ---


	/*
	Initializes a device.

	A device represents a physical audio device. The idea is you send or receive audio data from the device to either play it back through a speaker, or capture it
	from a microphone. Whether or not you should send or receive data from the device (or both) depends on the type of device you are initializing which can be
	playback, capture, full-duplex or loopback. (Note that loopback mode is only supported on select backends.) Sending and receiving audio data to and from the
	device is done via a callback which is fired by miniaudio at periodic time intervals.

	The frequency at which data is delivered to and from a device depends on the size of it's period. The size of the period can be defined in terms of PCM frames
	or milliseconds, whichever is more convenient. Generally speaking, the smaller the period, the lower the latency at the expense of higher CPU usage and
	increased risk of glitching due to the more frequent and granular data deliver intervals. The size of a period will depend on your requirements, but
	miniaudio's defaults should work fine for most scenarios. If you're building a game you should leave this fairly small, whereas if you're building a simple
	media player you can make it larger. Note that the period size you request is actually just a hint - miniaudio will tell the backend what you want, but the
	backend is ultimately responsible for what it gives you. You cannot assume you will get exactly what you ask for.

	When delivering data to and from a device you need to make sure it's in the correct format which you can set through the device configuration. You just set the
	format that you want to use and miniaudio will perform all of the necessary conversion for you internally. When delivering data to and from the callback you
	can assume the format is the same as what you requested when you initialized the device. See Remarks for more details on miniaudio's data conversion pipeline.


	Parameters
	----------
	pContext (in, optional)
	    A pointer to the context that owns the device. This can be null, in which case it creates a default context internally.

	pConfig (in)
	    A pointer to the device configuration. Cannot be null. See remarks for details.

	pDevice (out)
	    A pointer to the device object being initialized.


	Return Value
	------------
	MA_SUCCESS if successful; any other error code otherwise.


	Thread Safety
	-------------
	Unsafe. It is not safe to call this function simultaneously for different devices because some backends depend on and mutate global state. The same applies to
	calling this at the same time as `ma_device_uninit()`.


	Callback Safety
	---------------
	Unsafe. It is not safe to call this inside any callback.


	Remarks
	-------
	Setting `pContext` to NULL will result in miniaudio creating a default context internally and is equivalent to passing in a context initialized like so:

	    ```c
	    ma_context_init(NULL, 0, NULL, &context);
	    ```

	Do not set `pContext` to NULL if you are needing to open multiple devices. You can, however, use NULL when initializing the first device, and then use
	device.pContext for the initialization of other devices.

	The device can be configured via the `pConfig` argument. The config object is initialized with `ma_device_config_init()`. Individual configuration settings can
	then be set directly on the structure. Below are the members of the `ma_device_config` object.

	    deviceType
	        Must be `ma_device_type_playback`, `ma_device_type_capture`, `ma_device_type_duplex` of `ma_device_type_loopback`.

	    sampleRate
	        The sample rate, in hertz. The most common sample rates are 48000 and 44100. Setting this to 0 will use the device's native sample rate.

	    periodSizeInFrames
	        The desired size of a period in PCM frames. If this is 0, `periodSizeInMilliseconds` will be used instead. If both are 0 the default buffer size will
	        be used depending on the selected performance profile. This value affects latency. See below for details.

	    periodSizeInMilliseconds
	        The desired size of a period in milliseconds. If this is 0, `periodSizeInFrames` will be used instead. If both are 0 the default buffer size will be
	        used depending on the selected performance profile. The value affects latency. See below for details.

	    periods
	        The number of periods making up the device's entire buffer. The total buffer size is `periodSizeInFrames` or `periodSizeInMilliseconds` multiplied by
	        this value. This is just a hint as backends will be the ones who ultimately decide how your periods will be configured.

	    performanceProfile
	        A hint to miniaudio as to the performance requirements of your program. Can be either `ma_performance_profile_low_latency` (default) or
	        `ma_performance_profile_conservative`. This mainly affects the size of default buffers and can usually be left at it's default value.

	    noPreZeroedOutputBuffer
	        When set to true, the contents of the output buffer passed into the data callback will be left undefined. When set to false (default), the contents of
	        the output buffer will be cleared the zero. You can use this to avoid the overhead of zeroing out the buffer if you can guarantee that your data
	        callback will write to every sample in the output buffer, or if you are doing your own clearing.

	    noClip
	        When set to true, the contents of the output buffer passed into the data callback will be clipped after returning. When set to false (default), the
	        contents of the output buffer are left alone after returning and it will be left up to the backend itself to decide whether or not the clip. This only
	        applies when the playback sample format is f32.

	    dataCallback
	        The callback to fire whenever data is ready to be delivered to or from the device.

	    stopCallback
	        The callback to fire whenever the device has stopped, either explicitly via `ma_device_stop()`, or implicitly due to things like the device being
	        disconnected.

	    pUserData
	        The user data pointer to use with the device. You can access this directly from the device object like `device.pUserData`.

	    resampling.algorithm
	        The resampling algorithm to use when miniaudio needs to perform resampling between the rate specified by `sampleRate` and the device's native rate. The
	        default value is `ma_resample_algorithm_linear`, and the quality can be configured with `resampling.linear.lpfOrder`.

	    resampling.linear.lpfOrder
	        The linear resampler applies a low-pass filter as part of it's procesing for anti-aliasing. This setting controls the order of the filter. The higher
	        the value, the better the quality, in general. Setting this to 0 will disable low-pass filtering altogether. The maximum value is
	        `MA_MAX_FILTER_ORDER`. The default value is `min(4, MA_MAX_FILTER_ORDER)`.

	    playback.pDeviceID
	        A pointer to a `ma_device_id` structure containing the ID of the playback device to initialize. Setting this NULL (default) will use the system's
	        default playback device. Retrieve the device ID from the `ma_device_info` structure, which can be retrieved using device enumeration.

	    playback.format
	        The sample format to use for playback. When set to `ma_format_unknown` the device's native format will be used. This can be retrieved after
	        initialization from the device object directly with `device.playback.format`.

	    playback.channels
	        The number of channels to use for playback. When set to 0 the device's native channel count will be used. This can be retrieved after initialization
	        from the device object directly with `device.playback.channels`.

	    playback.channelMap
	        The channel map to use for playback. When left empty, the device's native channel map will be used. This can be retrieved after initialization from the
	        device object direct with `device.playback.channelMap`.

	    playback.shareMode
	        The preferred share mode to use for playback. Can be either `ma_share_mode_shared` (default) or `ma_share_mode_exclusive`. Note that if you specify
	        exclusive mode, but it's not supported by the backend, initialization will fail. You can then fall back to shared mode if desired by changing this to
	        ma_share_mode_shared and reinitializing.

	    capture.pDeviceID
	        A pointer to a `ma_device_id` structure containing the ID of the capture device to initialize. Setting this NULL (default) will use the system's
	        default capture device. Retrieve the device ID from the `ma_device_info` structure, which can be retrieved using device enumeration.

	    capture.format
	        The sample format to use for capture. When set to `ma_format_unknown` the device's native format will be used. This can be retrieved after
	        initialization from the device object directly with `device.capture.format`.

	    capture.channels
	        The number of channels to use for capture. When set to 0 the device's native channel count will be used. This can be retrieved after initialization
	        from the device object directly with `device.capture.channels`.

	    capture.channelMap
	        The channel map to use for capture. When left empty, the device's native channel map will be used. This can be retrieved after initialization from the
	        device object direct with `device.capture.channelMap`.

	    capture.shareMode
	        The preferred share mode to use for capture. Can be either `ma_share_mode_shared` (default) or `ma_share_mode_exclusive`. Note that if you specify
	        exclusive mode, but it's not supported by the backend, initialization will fail. You can then fall back to shared mode if desired by changing this to
	        ma_share_mode_shared and reinitializing.

	    wasapi.noAutoConvertSRC
	        WASAPI only. When set to true, disables WASAPI's automatic resampling and forces the use of miniaudio's resampler. Defaults to false.

	    wasapi.noDefaultQualitySRC
	        WASAPI only. Only used when `wasapi.noAutoConvertSRC` is set to false. When set to true, disables the use of `AUDCLNT_STREAMFLAGS_SRC_DEFAULT_QUALITY`.
	        You should usually leave this set to false, which is the default.

	    wasapi.noAutoStreamRouting
	        WASAPI only. When set to true, disables automatic stream routing on the WASAPI backend. Defaults to false.

	    wasapi.noHardwareOffloading
	        WASAPI only. When set to true, disables the use of WASAPI's hardware offloading feature. Defaults to false.

	    alsa.noMMap
	        ALSA only. When set to true, disables MMap mode. Defaults to false.

	    alsa.noAutoFormat
	        ALSA only. When set to true, disables ALSA's automatic format conversion by including the SND_PCM_NO_AUTO_FORMAT flag. Defaults to false.

	    alsa.noAutoChannels
	        ALSA only. When set to true, disables ALSA's automatic channel conversion by including the SND_PCM_NO_AUTO_CHANNELS flag. Defaults to false.

	    alsa.noAutoResample
	        ALSA only. When set to true, disables ALSA's automatic resampling by including the SND_PCM_NO_AUTO_RESAMPLE flag. Defaults to false.

	    pulse.pStreamNamePlayback
	        PulseAudio only. Sets the stream name for playback.

	    pulse.pStreamNameCapture
	        PulseAudio only. Sets the stream name for capture.

	    coreaudio.allowNominalSampleRateChange
	        Core Audio only. Desktop only. When enabled, allows the sample rate of the device to be changed at the operating system level. This
	        is disabled by default in order to prevent intrusive changes to the user's system. This is useful if you want to use a sample rate
	        that is known to be natively supported by the hardware thereby avoiding the cost of resampling. When set to true, miniaudio will
	        find the closest match between the sample rate requested in the device config and the sample rates natively supported by the
	        hardware. When set to false, the sample rate currently set by the operating system will always be used.


	Once initialized, the device's config is immutable. If you need to change the config you will need to initialize a new device.

	After initializing the device it will be in a stopped state. To start it, use `ma_device_start()`.

	If both `periodSizeInFrames` and `periodSizeInMilliseconds` are set to zero, it will default to `MA_DEFAULT_PERIOD_SIZE_IN_MILLISECONDS_LOW_LATENCY` or
	`MA_DEFAULT_PERIOD_SIZE_IN_MILLISECONDS_CONSERVATIVE`, depending on whether or not `performanceProfile` is set to `ma_performance_profile_low_latency` or
	`ma_performance_profile_conservative`.

	If you request exclusive mode and the backend does not support it an error will be returned. For robustness, you may want to first try initializing the device
	in exclusive mode, and then fall back to shared mode if required. Alternatively you can just request shared mode (the default if you leave it unset in the
	config) which is the most reliable option. Some backends do not have a practical way of choosing whether or not the device should be exclusive or not (ALSA,
	for example) in which case it just acts as a hint. Unless you have special requirements you should try avoiding exclusive mode as it's intrusive to the user.
	Starting with Windows 10, miniaudio will use low-latency shared mode where possible which may make exclusive mode unnecessary.

	When sending or receiving data to/from a device, miniaudio will internally perform a format conversion to convert between the format specified by the config
	and the format used internally by the backend. If you pass in 0 for the sample format, channel count, sample rate _and_ channel map, data transmission will run
	on an optimized pass-through fast path. You can retrieve the format, channel count and sample rate by inspecting the `playback/capture.format`,
	`playback/capture.channels` and `sampleRate` members of the device object.

	When compiling for UWP you must ensure you call this function on the main UI thread because the operating system may need to present the user with a message
	asking for permissions. Please refer to the official documentation for ActivateAudioInterfaceAsync() for more information.

	ALSA Specific: When initializing the default device, requesting shared mode will try using the "dmix" device for playback and the "dsnoop" device for capture.
	If these fail it will try falling back to the "hw" device.


	Example 1 - Simple Initialization
	---------------------------------
	This example shows how to initialize a simple playback device using a standard configuration. If you are just needing to do simple playback from the default
	playback device this is usually all you need.

	```c
	ma_device_config config = ma_device_config_init(ma_device_type_playback);
	config.playback.format   = ma_format_f32;
	config.playback.channels = 2;
	config.sampleRate        = 48000;
	config.dataCallback      = ma_data_callback;
	config.pMyUserData       = pMyUserData;

	ma_device device;
	ma_result result = ma_device_init(NULL, &config, &device);
	if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
	    // Error
	}
	```


	Example 2 - Advanced Initialization
	-----------------------------------
	This example shows how you might do some more advanced initialization. In this hypothetical example we want to control the latency by setting the buffer size
	and period count. We also want to allow the user to be able to choose which device to output from which means we need a context so we can perform device
	enumeration.

	```c
	ma_context context;
	ma_result result = ma_context_init(NULL, 0, NULL, &context);
	if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
	    // Error
	}

	ma_device_info* pPlaybackDeviceInfos;
	ma_uint32 playbackDeviceCount;
	result = ma_context_get_devices(&context, &pPlaybackDeviceInfos, &playbackDeviceCount, NULL, NULL);
	if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
	    // Error
	}

	// ... choose a device from pPlaybackDeviceInfos ...

	ma_device_config config = ma_device_config_init(ma_device_type_playback);
	config.playback.pDeviceID       = pMyChosenDeviceID;    // <-- Get this from the `id` member of one of the `ma_device_info` objects returned by ma_context_get_devices().
	config.playback.format          = ma_format_f32;
	config.playback.channels        = 2;
	config.sampleRate               = 48000;
	config.dataCallback             = ma_data_callback;
	config.pUserData                = pMyUserData;
	config.periodSizeInMilliseconds = 10;
	config.periods                  = 3;

	ma_device device;
	result = ma_device_init(&context, &config, &device);
	if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
	    // Error
	}
	```

	Callback Safety
	---------------

	Remarks
	-------
	This API needs to wait on the worker thread to stop the backend device properly before returning. It also waits on a mutex for thread-safety. In addition, some
	backends need to wait for the device to finish playback/recording of the current fragment which can take some time (usually proportionate to the buffer size
	that was specified at initialization time).

	Backends are required to either pause the stream in-place or drain the buffer if pausing is not possible. The reason for this is that stopping the device and
	the resuming it with ma_device_start() (which you might do when your program loses focus) may result in a situation where those samples are never output to the
	speakers or received from the microphone which can in turn result in de-syncs.

	Do not call this in any callback.

	Remarks
	-------
	The general flow of a devices state goes like this:

	MA_INVALID_ARGS if the gain is > 0.


	Thread Safety
	-------------
	Safe. This just sets a local member of the device object.


	Callback Safety
	---------------
	Safe. If you set the volume in the data callback, that data written to the output buffer will have the new volume applied.


	Remarks
	-------
	This applies the gain across all channels.

	This does not change the operating system's volume. It only affects the volume for the given `ma_device` object's audio stream.

	/*
	Called from the data callback of asynchronous backends to allow miniaudio to process the data and fire the miniaudio data callback.


	Parameters
	----------
	pDevice (in)
	    A pointer to device whose processing the data callback.

	pOutput (out)
	    A pointer to the buffer that will receive the output PCM frame data. On a playback device this must not be NULL. On a duplex device
	    this can be NULL, in which case pInput must not be NULL.

	pInput (in)
	    A pointer to the buffer containing input PCM frame data. On a capture device this must not be NULL. On a duplex device this can be
	    NULL, in which case `pOutput` must not be NULL.

	frameCount (in)
	    The number of frames being processed.


	Return Value
	------------
	MA_SUCCESS if successful; any other result code otherwise.


	Thread Safety
	-------------
	This function should only ever be called from the internal data callback of the backend. It is safe to call this simultaneously between a
	playback and capture device in duplex setups.


	Callback Safety
	---------------
	Do not call this from the miniaudio data callback. It should only ever be called from the internal data callback of the backend.


	Remarks
	-------
	If both `pOutput` and `pInput` are NULL, and error will be returned. In duplex scenarios, both `pOutput` and `pInput` can be non-NULL, in
	which case `pInput` will be processed first, followed by `pOutput`.

	If you are implementing a custom backend, and that backend uses a callback for data delivery, you'll need to call this from inside that
	callback.

	/*
	Calculates an appropriate buffer size from a descriptor, native sample rate and performance profile.

	This function is used by backends for helping determine an appropriately sized buffer to use with
	the device depending on the values of `periodSizeInFrames` and `periodSizeInMilliseconds` in the
	`pDescriptor` object. Since buffer size calculations based on time depends on the sample rate, a
	best guess at the device's native sample rate is also required which is where `nativeSampleRate`
	comes in. In addition, the performance profile is also needed for cases where both the period size
	in frames and milliseconds are both zero.


	Parameters
	----------
	pDescriptor (in)
	    A pointer to device descriptor whose `periodSizeInFrames` and `periodSizeInMilliseconds` members
	    will be used for the calculation of the buffer size.

	nativeSampleRate (in)
	    The device's native sample rate. This is only ever used when the `periodSizeInFrames` member of
	    `pDescriptor` is zero. In this case, `periodSizeInMilliseconds` will be used instead, in which
	    case a sample rate is required to convert to a size in frames.

	performanceProfile (in)
	    When both the `periodSizeInFrames` and `periodSizeInMilliseconds` members of `pDescriptor` are
	    zero, miniaudio will fall back to a buffer size based on the performance profile. The profile
	    to use for this calculation is determine by this parameter.


	Return Value
	------------
	The calculated buffer size in frames.


	Thread Safety
	-------------
	This is safe so long as nothing modifies `pDescriptor` at the same time. However, this function
	should only ever be called from within the backend's device initialization routine and therefore
	shouldn't have any multithreading concerns.


	Callback Safety
	---------------
	This is safe to call within the data callback, but there is no reason to ever do this.


	Remarks
	-------
	If `nativeSampleRate` is zero, this function will fall back to `pDescriptor->sampleRate`. If that
	is also zero, `MA_DEFAULT_SAMPLE_RATE` will be used instead.

	/*
	Retrieves compile-time enabled backends.


	Parameters
	----------
	pBackends (out, optional)
	    A pointer to the buffer that will receive the enabled backends. Set to NULL to retrieve the backend count. Setting
	    the capacity of the buffer to `MA_BUFFER_COUNT` will guarantee it's large enough for all backends.

	backendCap (in)
	    The capacity of the `pBackends` buffer.

	pBackendCount (out)
	    A pointer to the variable that will receive the enabled backend count.


	Return Value
	------------
	MA_SUCCESS if successful.
	MA_INVALID_ARGS if `pBackendCount` is NULL.
	MA_NO_SPACE if the capacity of `pBackends` is not large enough.

	If `MA_NO_SPACE` is returned, the `pBackends` buffer will be filled with `*pBackendCount` values.


	Thread Safety
	-------------
	Safe.


	Callback Safety
	---------------
	Safe.


	Remarks
	-------
	If you want to retrieve the number of backends so you can determine the capacity of `pBackends` buffer, you can call
	this function with `pBackends` set to NULL.

	This will also enumerate the null backend. If you don't want to include this you need to check for `ma_backend_null`
	when you enumerate over the returned backends and handle it appropriately. Alternatively, you can disable it at
	compile time with `MA_NO_NULL`.

	The returned backends are determined based on compile time settings, not the platform it's currently running on. For
	example, PulseAudio will be returned if it was enabled at compile time, even when the user doesn't actually have
	PulseAudio installed.


	Example 1
	---------
	The example below retrieves the enabled backend count using a fixed sized buffer allocated on the stack. The buffer is
	given a capacity of `MA_BACKEND_COUNT` which will guarantee it'll be large enough to store all available backends.
	Since `MA_BACKEND_COUNT` is always a relatively small value, this should be suitable for most scenarios.

	```
	ma_backend enabledBackends[MA_BACKEND_COUNT];
	size_t enabledBackendCount;

	result = ma_get_enabled_backends(enabledBackends, MA_BACKEND_COUNT, &enabledBackendCount);
	if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
	    // Failed to retrieve enabled backends. Should never happen in this example since all inputs are valid.
	}
