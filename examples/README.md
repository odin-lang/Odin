# Examples

The `example` directory contains two packages:

A [demo](examples/demo) illustrating the basics of Odin.

It further contains [all](examples/all), which imports all [core](core) and [vendor](vendor) packages so we can conveniently run `odin check` on everything at once.

For additional example code, see the [examples](https://github.com/odin-lang/examples) repository.
