/*
A handle to a dynamically loaded library.
*/
Library :: distinct rawptr

/*
Loads a dynamic library from the filesystem. The paramater `global_symbols` makes the symbols in the loaded
library available to resolve references in subsequently loaded libraries.

The paramater `global_symbols` is only used for the platforms `linux`, `darwin`, `freebsd` and `openbsd`.
On `windows` this paramater is ignored.

The underlying behaviour is platform specific.
On `linux`, `darwin`, `freebsd` and `openbsd` refer to `dlopen`.
On `windows` refer to `LoadLibraryW`.

		LIBRARY_PATH :: "my_library.dll"
		library, ok := dynlib.load_library(LIBRARY_PATH)

Unloads a dynamic library.

The underlying behaviour is platform specific.

/*
Scans a dynamic library for symbols matching a struct's members, assigning found procedure pointers to the corresponding entry.
Optionally takes a symbol prefix added to the struct's member name to construct the symbol looked up in the library.
Optionally also takes the struct member to assign the library handle to, `__handle` by default.

This allows using one struct to hold library handles and symbol pointers for more than 1 dynamic library.

Returns:
* -1 if the library could not be loaded.
* The number of symbols assigned on success.

See doc.odin for an example.
