Mutual exclusion lock.

A Mutex is a [[mutual exclusion lock; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion]]
It can be used to prevent more than one thread from entering the critical
section, and thus prevent access to same piece of memory by multiple threads, at
the same time.

Mutex's zero-initializzed value represents an initial, *unlocked* state.
 
If another thread tries to acquire the lock, while it's already held (typically
by another thread), the thread's execution will be blocked, until the lock is
released. Code or memory that is "surrounded" by a mutex lock and unlock
operations is said to be "guarded by a mutex".

**Note**: A Mutex must not be copied after first use (e.g., after locking it the
first time). This is because, in order to coordinate with other threads, all
threads must watch the same memory address to know when the lock has been
released. Trying to use a copy of the lock at a different memory address will
result in broken and unsafe behavior. For this reason, Mutexes are marked as
`#no_copy`.

**Note**: If the current thread attempts to lock a mutex, while it's already
holding another lock, that will cause a trivial case of deadlock. Do not use
`Mutex` in recursive functions. In case multiple locks by the same thread are
desired, use `Recursive_Mutex`.

Read-write mutual exclusion lock.

An `RW_Mutex` is a reader/writer mutual exclusion lock. The lock can be held by
any number of readers or a single writer.

This type of synchronization primitive supports two kinds of lock operations:

- Exclusive lock (write lock)
- Shared lock (read lock)

When an exclusive lock is acquired by any thread, all other threads, attempting
to acquire either an exclusive or shared lock, will be blocked from entering the
critical sections associated with the read-write mutex, until the exclusive
owner of the lock releases the lock.

When a shared lock is acquired by any thread, any other thread attempting to
acquire a shared lock will also be able to enter all the critical sections
associated with the read-write mutex. However threads attempting to acquire
an exclusive lock will be blocked from entering those critical sections, until
all shared locks are released.

**Note**: A read-write mutex must not be copied after first use (e.g., after
acquiring a lock). This is because, in order to coordinate with other threads,
all threads must watch the same memory address to know when the lock has been
released. Trying to use a copy of the lock at a different memory address will
result in broken and unsafe behavior. For this reason, mutexes are marked as
`#no_copy`.

**Note**: A read-write mutex is not recursive. Do not attempt to acquire an
exclusive lock more than once from the same thread, or an exclusive and shared
lock on the same thread. Taking a shared lock multiple times is acceptable.

Recursive mutual exclusion lock.

Recurisve mutex is just like a plain mutex, except it allows reentrancy. In

A condition variable.

`Cond` implements a condition variable, a rendezvous point for threads waiting
for signalling the occurence of an event. Condition variables are used in
conjuction with mutexes to provide a shared access to one or more shared
variable.

A typical usage of condition variable is as follows. A thread that intends to
modify a shared variable shall:

1. Acquire a lock on a mutex.
2. Modify the shared memory.
3. Release the lock.
3. Call `cond_signal` or `cond_broadcast`.

A thread that intends to wait on a shared variable shall:

1. Acquire a lock on a mutex.
2. Call `cond_wait` or `cond_wait_with_timeout` (will release the mutex).
3. Check the condition and keep waiting in a loop if not satisfied with result.

**Note**: A condition variable must not be copied after first use (e.g., after
waiting on it the first time). This is because, in order to coordinate with
other threads, all threads must watch the same memory address to know when the

Semaphore.

When waited upon, semaphore blocks until the internal count is greater than

This type of synchronization primitives can be useful for implementing queues.
The internal counter of the semaphore can be thought of as the amount of items
in the queue. After a data has been pushed to the queue, the thread shall call
`sema_post()` procedure, increasing the counter. When a thread takes an item
from the queue to do the job, it shall call `sema_wait()`, waiting on the
semaphore counter to become non-zero and decreasing it, if necessary.

**Note**: A semaphore must not be copied after first use (e.g., after posting
to it). This is because, in order to coordinate with other threads, all threads
must watch the same memory address to know when the lock has been released.
