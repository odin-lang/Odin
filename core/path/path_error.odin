package path

`core:path/slashpath - for paths separated by forward slashes, e.g. paths in URLs, this does not deal with OS-specific paths
core:path/filepath - uses either forward slashes or backslashes depending on the operating system, deals with Windows/NT paths with volume letters or backslashes (on the related platforms)`)
