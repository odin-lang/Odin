/*
The SIMD support package.

SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data), is a CPU hardware feature that
introduce special registers and instructions which operate on multiple units
of data at the same time, which enables faster data processing for
applications with heavy computational workloads.

In Odin SIMD is exposed via a special kinds of arrays, called the *SIMD
vectors*. The types of SIMD vectors is written as `#simd [N]T`, where N is a
power of two, and T could be any basic type (integers, floats, etc.). The
documentation of this package will call *SIMD vectors* just *vectors*.

SIMD vectors consist of elements, called *scalar values*, or
*scalars*, each occupying a *lane* of the SIMD vector. In the type declaration,
`N` specifies the amount of lanes, or values, that a vector stores.

This package implements procedures for working with vectors.

lanes_ge :: intrinsics.simd_lanes_ge

/*
Perform a gather load into a vector.

A *gather* operation is memory load operation, that loads values from an vector
of addresses into a single value vector. This can be used to achieve the
following results:

- Accessing every N'th element of an array (strided access)
- Access of elements according to some computed offsets (indexed access).
- Access of elements in a different order (shuffling access).

When used alongside other SIMD procedures in order to compute the offsets
for the `ptr` and `mask` parameters.

Inputs:
- `ptr`: A vector of memory locations. Each pointer points to a single value,
	of a SIMD vector's lane type that will be loaded into the vector. Pointer
	in this vector can be `nil` or any other invalid value, if the corresponding
	value in the `mask` parameter is zero.
- `val`: A vector of values that will be used at corresponding positions
	of the result vector, if the corresponding memory location has been
	masked out.
- `mask`: A vector of booleans or unsigned integers that determines which memory
	locations to read from. If the value at an index has the value true
	(lowest bit set), the value at that index will be loaded into the result
	vector from the corresponding memory location in the `ptr` vector. Otherwise
	the value will be loaded from the `val` vector.

Returns:
- A vector with all values from unmasked indices
loaded from the pointer vector `ptr`, and all values from masked indices loaded
from the value vector `val`.

**Operation**:

	for i in 0 ..< len(res) {
		if mask[i]&1 == 1 {
			res[i] = ptr[i]^

	// Example below loads 2 lanes of values from 2 lanes of float vectors, `v1` and
	// `v2`. From each of these vectors we're loading the second value, into the first
	// and the third position of the result vector.

	// Therefore the `ptrs` argument is initialized such that the first and the third
	// value are the addresses of the values that we want to load into the result
	// vector, and we'll fill in `nil` for the rest of them. To prevent CPU from
	// dereferencing those `nil` addresses we provide the mask that only allows us
	// to load valid positions of the `ptrs` array, and the array of defaults which
	// will have `127` in each position as the default value.

Perform a masked store to memory.

This procedure performs a masked store from a vector `val`, into memory at
address `ptr`, with the `mask` deciding which lanes are going to be stored,
and which aren't. If the mask at a corresponding lane has the value `true`
(lowest bit set), the lane is stored into memory. Otherwise the lane is not
stored into memory.

Inputs:
- `ptr`: The base address of the store.
- `val`: The vector to store.
- `mask`: The mask, selecting which lanes of the vector to store into memory.

**Operation**:

	for i in 0 ..< len(val) {
		if mask[i]&1 == 1 {
			ptr[i] = val
		}
	}

Example:

	// Example below stores the value 127 into the first and the third slot of the
	// vector `v`.

	import "core:fmt"
	import "core:simd"

	simd_masked_store_example :: proc() {
		v := [4] f32 {1, 2, 3, 4};
		mask := #simd [4]bool { true, false, true, false }
		vals := #simd [4]f32 { 0x7f, 0x7f, 0x7f, 0x7f }
		simd.masked_store(&v, vals, mask)
		fmt.println(v)
	}

Output:

	[127, 2, 127, 4]

masked_store :: intrinsics.simd_masked_store

/*
Load consecutive scalar values and expand into a vector.

This procedure loads a number of consecutive scalar values from an address,
specified by the `ptr` parameter, and stores them in a result vector, according
to the mask. The number of values read from memory is the number of set bits
in the mask. The lanes for which the mask has the value `true` get the next
consecutive value from memory, otherwise if the mask is `false` for the
lane, its value is filled from the corresponding lane of the `val` parameter.

This procedure acts like `masked_store`, except the values from memory are
read consecutively, and not according to the lanes. The memory values are read
and assigned to the result vector's masked lanes in order of increasing
addresses.

Inputs:
- `ptr`: The pointer to the memory to read from.
- `vals`: The default values for masked-off entries.
- `mask`: The mask that determines which lanes get consecutive memory values.

Returns:
- The result vector, holding masked memory values unmasked default values.

**Operation**:

	mem_idx := 0
	for i in 0 ..< len(mask) {
		if mask[i]&1 == 1 {
			res[i] = ptr[mem_idx]
			mem_idx += 1
		} else {
			res[i] = val[i]
		}
	}
	return res

Example:

	// The example below loads two values from memory of the vector `v`. Two values in
	// the mask are set to `true`, meaning only two memory items will be loaded into
	// the result vector. The mask is set to `true` in the first and the third
	// position, which specifies that the first memory item will be read into the
	// first lane of the result vector, and the second memory item will be read into
	// the third lane of the result vector. All the other lanes of the result vector
	// will be initialized to the default value `127`.

	import "core:simd"

		v := [2] f64 {1, 2};

shuffle :: intrinsics.simd_shuffle

/*
Select values from one of the two vectors.

This procedure returns a vector, which has, on each lane a value from one of the
corresponding lanes in one of the two input vectors based on the `cond`
parameter. On each lane, if the value of the `cond` parameter is `true` (or
non-zero), the result lane will have a value from the `true` input vector,
otherwise the result lane will have a value from the `false` input vector.

Inputs:
- `cond`: The condition vector.
- `true`: The first input vector.
- `false`: The second input vector.

Result:
- The result of selecting values from the two input vectors.

**Operation**:

	res = {}
	for i in 0 ..< len(cond) {
		if cond[i] {
			res[i] = true[i]
		} else {
			res[i] = false[i]
		}
	}
	return res

Example:

	// The following example selects values from the two input vectors, `a` and `b`
	// into a single vector.

	import "core:fmt"
	import "core:simd"

	simd_select_example :: proc() {
		a := #simd [4] f64 { 1,2,3,4 }
		b := #simd [4] f64 { 5,6,7,8 }
		cond := #simd[4] int { 1, 0, 1, 0 }
		fmt.println(simd.select(cond,a,b))
	}

Output:
	
	<1, 6, 3, 8>

Graphically, the operation looks as follows. The `t` and `f` represent the
`true` and `false` vectors respectively:
