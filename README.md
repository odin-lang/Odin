# The Odin Programming Language

The Odin programming language is fast, concise, readable, pragmatic and open sourced. It is designed with the intent of replacing C with the following goals:
* simplicity
* high performance
* built for modern systems
* joy of programming
* metaprogramming

## Requirements to build and run

- Windows
	* x86-64
	* MSVC 2015 installed (C++11 support)
	* [LLVM binaries](https://github.com/gingerBill/Odin/releases/tag/llvm-4.0-windows) for `opt.exe` and `llc.exe`
	* Requires MSVC's link.exe as the linker
		* run `vcvarsall.bat` to setup the path

- MacOS
	* x86-64
	* LLVM explicitly installed (`brew install llvm`)
	* XCode installed (for the linker)

- GNU/Linux
	* x86-64
	* Build tools (ld)
	* LLVM installed
	* Clang installed (temporary - this is Calling the linker for now)

## Warnings

* This is still highly in development and the language's design is quite volatile.
* Syntax is not fixed.

## Roadmap

Not in any particular order and not be implemented

* Compile Time Execution (CTE)
	- More metaprogramming madness
	- Compiler as a library
	- AST inspection and modification
* CTE-based build system
* Replace LLVM backend with my own custom backend
* Improve SSA design to accommodate for lowering to a "bytecode"
* SSA optimizations
* Documentation Generator for "Entities"
* Multiple Architecture support
* Debug Information
	- pdb format too
* Command Line Tooling
* Compiler Internals:
	- Big numbers library
	- Multithreading for performance increase
