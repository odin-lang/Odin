# The Odin Programming Language

The Odin programming language is fast, concise, readable, pragmatic and open sourced. It is designed with the intent of replacing C with the following goals:
* simplicity
* high performance
* built for modern systems
* joy of programming

Website: [https://odin-lang.org/](https://odin-lang.org/)

```odin
package main

import "core:fmt"

main :: proc() {
	program := "+ + * ðŸ˜ƒ - /";
	accumulator := 0;

	for token in program {
		switch token {
		case '+': accumulator += 1;
		case '-': accumulator -= 1;
		case '*': accumulator *= 2;
		case '/': accumulator /= 2;
		case 'ðŸ˜ƒ': accumulator *= accumulator;
		case: // Ignore everything else
		}
	}

	fmt.printf("The program \"%s\" calculates the value %d\n",
	           program, accumulator);
}

```

## Setup

Odin only supports x86-64 at the moment (64-bit), relies on LLVM for code generation and an external linker.

In addition, the following platform-specific steps are necessary:

- Windows
    * Have Visual Studio installed (MSVC 2010 or later, for the linker)
    * Have a copy of `opt.exe` and `llc.exe` in `Odin/bin`. Pre-built Windows binaries can be found [here](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/releases/tag/llvm-windows) and *must* be explicitly copied
    * Open a valid command prompt:
        * **Basic:** run the `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2017` shortcut bundled with VS 2017, or
        * **Advanced:** run `vcvarsall.bat x64` from a blank `cmd` session

- MacOS
    * Have LLVM explicitly installed (`brew install llvm`)
    * Have XCode installed (version X.X or later, for linking)
    * Make sure the LLVM binaries and the linker are added to your `$PATH` environmental variable

- GNU/Linux
    * Have LLVM installed (opt/llc)
    * Have Clang installed (version X.X or later, for linking)
    * Make sure the LLVM binaries and the linker are added to your `$PATH` environmental variable

Then build the compiler by calling `build.bat` (Windows) or `make` (Linux/MacOS). This will automatically run the demo program if successful.

**Notes for Linux:**: The compiler currently relies on the `core` and `shared` library collection being relative to the compiler executable. Installing the compiler in the usual sense (to `/usr/local/bin` or similar) is therefore not as straight forward as you need to make sure the mentioned libraries are available. As a result, it is recommended to simply explicitly invoke the compiler with `/path/to/odin` in your preferred build system, or add `/path/to/odin` to `$PATH`.

Please read the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/wiki#getting-started-with-odin) for more information.

## Requirements to build and run

Please read the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/wiki#getting-started-with-odin).

- Windows
	* x86-64
	* MSVC 2010 installed (C++11 support)
	* [LLVM binaries](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/releases/tag/llvm-windows) for `opt.exe`, `llc.exe`, and `lld-link.exe`
	* Requires MSVC's link.exe as the linker
		* run `vcvarsall.bat` to setup the path

- MacOS
	* x86-64
	* LLVM explicitly installed (`brew install llvm`)
	* XCode installed (for the linker)

- GNU/Linux
	* x86-64
	* Build tools (ld)
	* LLVM installed
	* Clang installed (temporary - this is Calling the linker for now)

## Warnings

* This is still highly in development and the language's design is quite volatile.
* Syntax is not fixed.
