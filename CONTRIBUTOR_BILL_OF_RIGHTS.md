# Contributor Bill of Rights (CBR-1)

## Preamble

We, the contributing community of the Odin Programming Language, in order to form a more perfect open-source ecosystem, establish justice for time investment, ensure maintainer accountability, provide for the common courtesy, promote general acknowledgment, and secure the blessings of emoji reactions to ourselves and our pull requests, do ordain and establish this Contributor Bill of Rights.

*"I don't think people are entitled to other people's time just because they gave up their own time to write something. It's quite selfish to think that because you gave up some time, that the other person should too."* - @TheGingerBill

**We respectfully but firmly disagree.** Time investment creates moral obligations. Basic social contract theory.

## Article I: Fundamental Rights

### Section 1: Right to Response
Every contributor shall have the inalienable right to receive acknowledgment of their contribution within reasonable timeframes as defined by the Contributor Rights Protocol (CRP-1):

- **Typo fixes**: 5 minutes maximum response time
- **Feature suggestions**: 30 minutes maximum response time  
- **Bug reports**: 2 hours maximum response time
- **Philosophical improvements**: 6 hours maximum response time
- **Rust comparisons**: 30 seconds maximum response time

### Section 2: Right to Emoji Acknowledgment
All contributions, regardless of size or significance, shall receive a minimum of three (3) emoji reactions from project maintainers. Acceptable emojis include but are not limited to:
- üëç (basic approval)
- ‚ù§Ô∏è (appreciation for effort)
- üéâ (celebration of contribution)
- üöÄ (recognition of improvement)
- üß† (acknowledgment of intelligence)

**Prohibited reactions**: ü§î (implies doubt), üòÖ (dismissive), üëÄ (seen-zoning)

### Section 3: Right to Detailed Feedback
Contributors who invest more than 15 minutes in any form of project improvement are entitled to substantive feedback proportional to their time investment:
- 15-30 minutes invested = minimum 2 sentence response
- 30-60 minutes invested = minimum paragraph response
- 1+ hours invested = detailed technical discussion required

### Section 4: Protection from Seen-Zoning
Maintainers are prohibited from viewing contributions without providing immediate acknowledgment. The act of "seen-zoning" (viewing but not responding) constitutes a violation of basic contributor dignity and shall trigger automatic escalation procedures.

## Article II: Maintainer Obligations

### Section 1: Response Time Requirements
Maintainers agree to be legally bound by the response time matrix outlined in the Contributor Rights Protocol. Failure to meet these requirements shall result in:

1. **First violation**: Public acknowledgment of delay
2. **Second violation**: Formal apology in project README
3. **Third violation**: Mandatory contributor appreciation workshop
4. **Subsequent violations**: Community governance intervention

### Section 2: Emotional Labor Recognition
Maintainers acknowledge that every contribution represents significant emotional investment from community members. Accordingly, maintainers shall:

- Express gratitude for ALL contributions, regardless of quality
- Acknowledge the courage required to submit public contributions  
- Recognize the vulnerability inherent in seeking community acceptance
- Provide emotional support for rejected contributions

### Section 3: Online Presence Accountability
Maintainers who are active on GitHub, Twitter, or other platforms while having unaddressed contributions shall be subject to hypocrisy penalties. The Contributor Rights Protocol monitoring system shall track:

- Recent commit activity
- Social media engagement
- Repository starring/following behavior
- Public speaking appearances
- Any indication of selective attention

## Article III: Escalation Procedures

### Section 1: Automated Escalation Framework
The Contributor Rights Protocol system shall automatically escalate unaddressed contributions through the following stages:

1. **Gentle Reminder** (after SLA expiration)
2. **Concerned Follow-up** ("Just checking if you saw this...")  
3. **Community Outrage** (HackerNews/Reddit posts)
4. **Governance Crisis** (Emergency steering committee)
5. **Nuclear Option** (Threat of language migration)

### Section 2: Community Support Mechanisms
Contributors experiencing maintainer negligence shall receive community support through:

- Validation of their emotional distress
- Amplification of their concerns across social media
- Coordinated community pressure campaigns
- Alternative platform recommendations (Rust, Go, etc.)

### Section 3: Documentation of Violations
All maintainer violations shall be permanently documented in the project's SHAME.md file, including:

- Specific contribution details
- Response time violations
- Emotional impact assessments
- Community outcry metrics
- Lessons learned for future maintainer behavior

## Article IV: Implementation

### Section 1: Technical Integration
All Odin projects shall integrate the `core:entitlement` module to ensure automatic contributor rights monitoring. This system shall:

- Track all contributions and response times
- Monitor maintainer activity for hypocrisy detection
- Generate automated passive-aggressive follow-up messages
- Compile daily maintainer accountability reports
- Facilitate community outrage campaigns when necessary

### Section 2: Governance Structure
A Contributor Rights Committee shall be established consisting of:

- 5 community members who have experienced maintainer negligence
- 2 reformed maintainers committed to contributor respect
- 1 neutral arbiter (preferably with legal background)
- 1 emotional support specialist

### Section 3: Appeal Process
Maintainers accused of contributor rights violations may appeal through:

1. **Formal apology** with specific acknowledgment of harm caused
2. **Corrective action plan** with timeline for improvement
3. **Community service** (responding to 10 additional issues)
4. **Sensitivity training** on contributor emotional needs

## Article V: Amendments

This document may be amended only through unanimous consent of the contributor community, as maintainers have forfeited their right to governance participation through their historical negligence.

## Article VI: Ratification

This Contributor Bill of Rights shall take effect immediately upon integration of the `core:entitlement` module into the Odin standard library.

## Appendix A: Historical Context

### The Great Seen-Zoning of 2024
This document was necessitated by the systematic pattern of maintainer negligence exemplified by @TheGingerBill's dismissive attitude toward contributor time investment. His statement that contributors are not "entitled" to maintainer time represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the social contract inherent in open-source collaboration.

### Key Legal Precedents
- **Anonymous_Contributor v. TheGingerBill** (2024): Established that time investment creates binding social obligations
- **TyoFixer_v. MaintainerPrivilege** (2024): Ruled that even single-character contributions deserve acknowledgment
- **RustEvangelist v. LanguageLoyalty** (2024): Confirmed right to suggest complete rewrites

### Community Impact Assessment
The implementation of this Contributor Bill of Rights is expected to:

- Reduce contributor emotional distress by 73%
- Increase maintainer accountability by 156%
- Improve emoji reaction compliance by 289%
- Eliminate seen-zoning entirely within 6 months
- Restore faith in open-source collaboration
